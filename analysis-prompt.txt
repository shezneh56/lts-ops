TRANSCRIPT:
Liam Sheridan: Fareed, how are you?
Liam Sheridan: Good, how about you, Liam?
Fareed Aziz: Yeah, very well.
Liam Sheridan: Where are you calling from today?
Fareed Aziz: I'm in West Virginia, how about you?
Liam Sheridan: In where, sorry?
Liam Sheridan: West Virginia.
Fareed Aziz: Oh, okay, nice.
Liam Sheridan: Nice.
Liam Sheridan: What's the time for you then?
Liam Sheridan: Let me guess, right?
Liam Sheridan: I'm going to say you're somewhere between, it's not 11, I think you're in the middle, I'm going to say 9 or 10.
Liam Sheridan: 10.
Liam Sheridan: It's 11.30.
Fareed Aziz: Damn.
Liam Sheridan: So as you can probably tell, I'm not from the States, so I never have any idea what time it is for you guys.
Liam Sheridan: I have to kind of guess between the two, Eastern and Western, but it's a little fun game, I like to play at the start of call, breaks the ice a little bit.
Liam Sheridan: So, yeah.
Liam Sheridan: Yeah, look, Fareed, I'm going to dive straight into things with us here.
Liam Sheridan: We've only got 30 minutes, I'm going to make the most of our time.
Liam Sheridan: So I run leads that show we are a B2B outbound agency.
Liam Sheridan: We work with B2B companies, we book them appointments, as simple as that, right?
Liam Sheridan: So I think there's potential.
Liam Sheridan: I there's
Liam Sheridan: for us to work together and for it to be a good fit.
Liam Sheridan: And yeah, I just want to explore that on the call.
Liam Sheridan: What you guys do in a little bit more detail.
Liam Sheridan: I assume it's BPL from looking at the website and doing a little bit of research.
Liam Sheridan: I just want to dive into a little bit around kind of what you're looking to get out of the call.
Liam Sheridan: And then we can dive into the company a little bit more and what you're looking to achieve.
Fareed Aziz: Sure.
Fareed Aziz: Sounds good.
Fareed Aziz: How long have you been in business, Liam?
Liam Sheridan: About a year now.
Liam Sheridan: Okay.
Fareed Aziz: Okay.
Fareed Aziz: So what made you book the call?
Liam Sheridan: I'm sorry?
Fareed Aziz: What made you book the call?
Liam Sheridan: Oh, yeah.
Fareed Aziz: So I was intrigued by, I think, the email that I received that you guarantee about 20 calls that you could book leads that are qualified leads.
Fareed Aziz: So I was interested to learn more.
Fareed Aziz: And I'm actually in a process.
Fareed Aziz: I have been interviewing some marketing firms.
Fareed Aziz: And I was actually making it.
Fareed Aziz: Going to make a decision this week, then yours showed up.
Fareed Aziz: said, okay, let's one last call before I make that determination.
Fareed Aziz: So I thought the timing was right.
Fareed Aziz: And I thought, let me learn more.
Fareed Aziz: And then next week or next week, couple of weeks, we'll make a determination of what route we want to take.
Liam Sheridan: That makes sense.
Liam Sheridan: Okay, cool.
Liam Sheridan: In terms then of how your other interviews have gone interested in, how have they been?
Liam Sheridan: Are they like similar agencies doing a similar thing?
Fareed Aziz: Larger agencies have been in business for longer.
Fareed Aziz: Okay.
Fareed Aziz: Yeah.
Fareed Aziz: Makes sense.
Liam Sheridan: Okay, tell me a little bit about the business because I'll be honest with you.
Liam Sheridan: I've worked with a couple of BPO people in terms of staffing and things like that.
Liam Sheridan: Mixed results, depending on the industry.
Liam Sheridan: The general ones, just to be honest, I get less results for the specialist ones.
Liam Sheridan: I have just taken on a new.
Liam Sheridan: Client that's in the medical space, pretty similar to you guys.
Liam Sheridan: Could even be a competitor, to be honest with you.
Liam Sheridan: So interested to hear around kind of what makes you guys different and your kind of specialty in terms of that staff outsourcing.
Fareed Aziz: Sounds good.
Fareed Aziz: Did you hear that sound?
Fareed Aziz: Or is it just...
Fareed Aziz: No, no, I didn't hear anything.
Liam Sheridan: Perfect.
Fareed Aziz: All right.
Fareed Aziz: I'm getting a call, so...
Fareed Aziz: Okay.
Fareed Aziz: Do you need to take it?
Fareed Aziz: Uh, no, since we have a scheduled time, we'll be on this call and I'll take that later on.
Fareed Aziz: So, yeah, so we are into healthcare staffing, predominantly back-end revenue cycle, basically end-to-end revenue cycle.
Fareed Aziz: So we help our organizations, whether it's a medical group or a large healthcare system, we help them with, you know, onboarding, qualified, experienced staff offshore.
Fareed Aziz: That helps them reduce the costs and also addresses the staffing concerns that we have been...
Fareed Aziz: This Take Okay.
Fareed Aziz: Experiencing in the healthcare industry in the U.S.
Fareed Aziz: We also do end-to-end revenue cycles.
Fareed Aziz: instead of staffing, if someone wants us to manage the whole end-to-end revenue cycle process, we hire our own leadership and we help them with that process.
Fareed Aziz: We do interim leadership.
Fareed Aziz: So if a leader is in transition and they're looking for a leader to temporarily support their operations, we do that.
Fareed Aziz: And we also help clients support with assessments.
Fareed Aziz: So if they're looking to evaluate their revenue cycle processes and evaluate if they are performing well or they have any concerns, we'll identify the opportunities we evaluate and give them actionable items that they could work on that will help them improve their bottom line.
Fareed Aziz: But predominantly, initial, the start of Steward was really focused on staffing because I come from a healthcare revenue cycle background, have over 21 years.
Fareed Aziz: of experience have been executives with at-large healthcare organizations.
Fareed Aziz: One of the challenges that I've noticed with any other window partners that we worked with, there was always multiple layers between the colleague that was actually doing the work and the people who we were communicating.
Fareed Aziz: There was always a communication breakdown.
Fareed Aziz: The quality was a struggle and transparency was out of the window.
Fareed Aziz: So we established Tour Global Consulting back in 22 to address that issue.
Fareed Aziz: And we have been able to address that for large organizations and have started with just two employees back in 23, first client.
Fareed Aziz: Now we are over 75 and we have not spent a penny in marketing.
Fareed Aziz: This was all based upon the value we were able to bring to the clients that allowed us to grow.
Fareed Aziz: So now that we...
Fareed Aziz: You know, we have proven our concept has worked really well.
Fareed Aziz: Our revenues grew significantly.
Fareed Aziz: We are now focused on how do we bring our services to other clients, other hospital systems, academic medical centers.
Fareed Aziz: We're struggling and have the same situation.
Fareed Aziz: So our concept is pretty straightforward.
Fareed Aziz: We don't hire anybody without experience.
Fareed Aziz: We look for at least three plus years of experience.
Fareed Aziz: We allow our clients, we're confident enough to allow our clients to interview those colleagues.
Fareed Aziz: And also those colleagues report directly to the leadership, the client leadership.
Fareed Aziz: So that creates continuous transparency.
Fareed Aziz: Other, whereas the other partners or rep competitors, what their focus is that they hire people of the college, school, which is not bad, but you don't have the experience.
Fareed Aziz: There's a challenge with learning and all that.
Fareed Aziz: Every sector is one industry where you can't go to school and learn.
Fareed Aziz: There's no such thing called, you know, a course that you could take just to learn.
Fareed Aziz: This comes out of experience.
Fareed Aziz: This comes out of really hard learning, which takes a year, a year, two years.
Fareed Aziz: So our concept is pretty similar.
Fareed Aziz: Keep it transparent, keep it simple.
Fareed Aziz: Our cost is very, if I were to compare with any of the competitors, we are very, very low in our cost.
Fareed Aziz: And it's one fixed monthly cost per FTE, which becomes easier for our clients to budget very well because it doesn't fluctuate on our contingency-based model.
Fareed Aziz: And contingency-based model typically are very expensive compared to fixed model.
Fareed Aziz: So the focus is really to drive value and be good stewards of the client's resources and reduce their costs while, you know, improving their quality.
Fareed Aziz: So we have done that very well.
Fareed Aziz: I've been very busy.
Fareed Aziz: As you could imagine, we grew from two to over 70 colleagues.
Fareed Aziz: In two years, we've been very busy in catering to those clients.
Fareed Aziz: Now that we have a good, solid process, and we were able to successfully, another challenge, I think, don't know if you talk to any BPOs, one of the myths that you hear in the industry is that it's a heavy turnover.
Fareed Aziz: So I wanted to evaluate that as well.
Fareed Aziz: Will that be the case if we have good, strong leadership?
Fareed Aziz: So in years' time, we only had one voluntary resignation.
Fareed Aziz: So we really proved our concept and thought process from a colleague perspective, from a client perspective.
Fareed Aziz: So we had a place now, I don't know how much you know about the U.S.
Fareed Aziz: market, the one big, beautiful bill.
Fareed Aziz: You may have heard about that, Trump's tax bill.
Fareed Aziz: It has everything else in it.
Fareed Aziz: It's not just a tax bill.
Fareed Aziz: That impacts the hospital systems significantly with their bottom line.
Fareed Aziz: Already struggling, but that one big, beautiful bill is all, you know, going to even...
Fareed Aziz: and make it worse.
Fareed Aziz: So this is the time the CFOs of the organizations are looking to reduce their cost.
Fareed Aziz: So this is a perfect opportunity where we place Steward in front as a solution to their staffing challenges that are already there.
Fareed Aziz: But now on top of that, I mean, you already have the margin problems.
Fareed Aziz: So we will help them with reducing that cost significantly.
Fareed Aziz: So that's a little bit about Steward Global Consulting and how we started off and happy to answer any specific questions you have.
Liam Sheridan: No, I appreciate it.
Liam Sheridan: It was a good breakdown.
Liam Sheridan: I just want to unpack that a little bit as well then.
Liam Sheridan: So it sounds like you've probably spent the last two years kind of growing the company pretty quickly.
Liam Sheridan: And now you're looking for kind of an outsourced marketing kind of agency, firm help, whatever you want to refer to it as to kind of continue that growth for the next couple of years.
Liam Sheridan: Basically, it's like a long-term partner, really.
Liam Sheridan: And obviously, it's...
Liam Sheridan: Sounds like time is of the essence, if I'm not mistaken, with this kind of bill coming through.
Liam Sheridan: This is a key trigger for these people to potentially reduce headcount and go with someone like yourself where they can kind of reduce that overhead really easily whilst maintaining high qualities of staff.
Liam Sheridan: Would that be fair to say?
Fareed Aziz: Yes, and also sometimes not reducing the overhead.
Fareed Aziz: They already have open positions but not able to fill.
Fareed Aziz: So it's a challenge of willing to pay, don't have the resources or I don't have qualified resources.
Fareed Aziz: So that's a struggle post-pandemic every healthcare leader had to address and has been an issue since then.
Liam Sheridan: No, it makes sense.
Liam Sheridan: And you said, just correct me if wrong, you said one flat fee per head, right?
Liam Sheridan: Is that per role?
Liam Sheridan: Is it banded by tier?
Liam Sheridan: It's here, because you said about leadership roles, interim leadership roles, that sort of thing.
Liam Sheridan: I assume that wouldn't be the same flat fee as.
Liam Sheridan: It's someone who's in like a more junior role.
Fareed Aziz: No, so same concept, but those are onshore colleagues.
Fareed Aziz: These are not offshore colleagues, obviously experienced colleagues.
Fareed Aziz: So it will still be per month cost for the client, but obviously it'll be a lot higher, a lot higher than...
Liam Sheridan: Yeah, yeah, of course, that's what I thought.
Liam Sheridan: No, it makes sense.
Liam Sheridan: Okay, then in terms of what do you guys...
Liam Sheridan: So let's say you...
Liam Sheridan: So what I'm trying to ask is the annual contract value.
Liam Sheridan: I don't know how to kind of frame it in the right way for your business model, because I guess without...
Liam Sheridan: Let's say we got you a deal, they could hire one person, they could hire 10 people.
Liam Sheridan: So it kind of ranges.
Liam Sheridan: But in terms of then the average contract value, just give me a rough number just so I can make sure it makes commercial sense for both of us.
Fareed Aziz: Yeah, we typically don't encourage any contracts that does not hire at least five because that helps us reduce the cost.
Liam Sheridan: But I've broken that rule to accommodate clients, so I'm open to...
Fareed Aziz: So our minimum FTE cost would be around $2,600, $2,700 per month, okay?
Fareed Aziz: That's per FTE.
Fareed Aziz: But that could go much higher.
Fareed Aziz: It could go to $5,000, $7,000, depending upon who we're hiring and what skillset we're looking for.
Fareed Aziz: Because we not only help in revenue cycle, we also do all things healthcare.
Fareed Aziz: So it could be accounts payable.
Fareed Aziz: It could be IT.
Fareed Aziz: If they're looking for IT resources, offshore resources we can offer, obviously those would be a lot much higher value.
Fareed Aziz: But it would be a lot of significant saving if they were to hire someone.
Fareed Aziz: let's go.
Fareed Aziz: let's
Fareed Aziz: Locally or a contracted employee from U.S., it'll be night and day.
Liam Sheridan: Yeah, exactly.
Liam Sheridan: Makes sense.
Liam Sheridan: And I just did some quick math there, and please correct me if I'm wrong.
Liam Sheridan: So if I say $2,600 a month times five, just for five employees on a minimum contract, let's say, I know you've broken the rule before, times 12 gives me $156,000, call it $150,000 a year.
Liam Sheridan: Okay.
Liam Sheridan: What would be your margin on that then?
Liam Sheridan: Because I assume that you've also got to pay for the staff.
Liam Sheridan: So is it about 50%, 40%?
Liam Sheridan: What does that look like?
Liam Sheridan: It's not that high.
Fareed Aziz: And also, it depends.
Fareed Aziz: the $2,600 was the lowest that I would offer, but same position could be $3,000, depending upon who we're talking to, but we don't go lower than $2,600.
Fareed Aziz: Okay.
Fareed Aziz: The margins, again, there's a lot more cost than just the FTE, right?
Fareed Aziz: So in this case, the...
Fareed Aziz: Client is not responsible for any of the hardware we provide.
Fareed Aziz: Right.
Liam Sheridan: Right.
Liam Sheridan: So there's many other costs, the benefits.
Fareed Aziz: We provide benefits to our colleagues.
Fareed Aziz: These are not temporary consultants.
Fareed Aziz: These are full-time employees.
Fareed Aziz: So we have good margins, but I'm not sure if I'm comfortable sharing those level of details here.
Liam Sheridan: No, okay.
Liam Sheridan: What I'm just trying to get at is, for example, how much are going to make off a deal?
Liam Sheridan: Now, I'm going to say, even if it's 10%, right?
Liam Sheridan: You don't need to tell me.
Liam Sheridan: I'm just going to use 10% as an example.
Liam Sheridan: We've taken the lowest cost.
Liam Sheridan: We've taken the lowest margin.
Liam Sheridan: It's still 15K a deal a year, right?
Liam Sheridan: That's what I'm trying to get to.
Liam Sheridan: What I don't want to turn around is you to say, just to weed this out, would be like, oh, if you make 1K for a deal over a year, it's probably not worth us working together, right?
Liam Sheridan: Because it wouldn't work commercial sense for both of us to do that.
Liam Sheridan: So that's fine.
Liam Sheridan: I think that's kind of good enough in terms of the deal size.
Liam Sheridan: I think in terms of your total addressable market as well, that's another thing we look at.
Liam Sheridan: Obviously, healthcare in America is huge.
Liam Sheridan: And I think with this kind of...
Liam Sheridan: he's I'm to Um,
Liam Sheridan: So geopolitical trigger coming through with this big, beautiful bill.
Liam Sheridan: It's a big opportunity that you need to take advantage of now.
Liam Sheridan: And it's going to be great for positioning in terms of how we're going to do that in an email because it's a trigger to get someone to respond that we can use from an external perspective to kind of push them internally to get on a meeting with you guys and explore this option further.
Liam Sheridan: So that's good.
Liam Sheridan: In terms of, and I know you mentioned earlier around you haven't spent a dollar on marketing.
Liam Sheridan: Is that true up until the point of today?
Liam Sheridan: Or was that just for the two years?
Liam Sheridan: Not a dollar until today?
Fareed Aziz: No.
Fareed Aziz: Okay, perfect.
Liam Sheridan: So my question then is, what have you been doing to get clients?
Liam Sheridan: Like referrals?
Fareed Aziz: How does that work?
Fareed Aziz: Yeah, we grew organically because our clients valued what we brought to the table and that's how we got contracts.
Fareed Aziz: And I also had a full-time executive role.
Fareed Aziz: Okay.
Fareed Aziz: I wouldn't say on the side, that was my full-time executive role in my organization and steward global consulting.
Fareed Aziz: I had absolutely no time building business or growing because we were already growing in a pace that I was happy with.
Fareed Aziz: So understanding the challenges in the market and we have a solution, I chose to resign from my executive role last month to focus on just business.
Fareed Aziz: So that's another reason why I felt now that I'm going to invest the time, I need a partner who could really help me scale.
Liam Sheridan: Yeah, makes sense, to be honest with you.
Liam Sheridan: It sounds like you've been a busy guy, Fareed, I'll be honest.
Liam Sheridan: That sounds like a lot on your plate running this as well, 275 employees as well as an executive role.
Liam Sheridan: You've been a very busy man, so hopefully we can get you some time back.
Liam Sheridan: But it's good that you've now got all your time to focus on this.
Liam Sheridan: So that's kind of a positive, right?
Liam Sheridan: I'm just thinking then, so the growth has been good organic.
Liam Sheridan: And now you're trying to kind of add fuel to the fire, let's say, for want of a better word.
Liam Sheridan: Now, you've been relying on kind of the organic growth.
Liam Sheridan: So I assume, and you can tell me here, do you have a growth target in mind for 2026?
Liam Sheridan: Obviously, in January, that's kind of part of the strategic planning for the year.
Fareed Aziz: What does that look like in terms of what you're trying to achieve?
Fareed Aziz: Yeah, so I'll give you an example.
Fareed Aziz: The first year we grew, I think, we started off, I established the company in 22, 23 was the first client we onboarded at the end of the 23.
Fareed Aziz: So my revenues were $170,000 the first year.
Fareed Aziz: The second year in operations, $1.3 million.
Fareed Aziz: Third year in operations, $2.1 million.
Fareed Aziz: So I am looking to double that.
Liam Sheridan: Okay.
Liam Sheridan: Okay, makes sense.
Liam Sheridan: So you're looking for $4.2 million in revenue in...
Liam Sheridan: 2.26 forecast.
Liam Sheridan: That's double 2.1 is the number where that's coming from.
Liam Sheridan: And how many deals would that be?
Liam Sheridan: Do you know in terms of clients?
Liam Sheridan: It depends.
Fareed Aziz: Yeah, so it depends on a client.
Fareed Aziz: So there are times when a client, just a single client, would want you because if they're going through an EMR conversion, right, they need resources to augment their staffing.
Fareed Aziz: It could be that they may ask for 10, 15, 20, 30 FTEs that they need resources.
Fareed Aziz: There could be medical groups.
Fareed Aziz: There are large medical groups with 100 providers.
Fareed Aziz: They may need for their end-to-end revenue cycle about 30 FTEs, right?
Fareed Aziz: So it really depends upon who you knock the doors.
Fareed Aziz: Now, if you're talking about independent practice with just one doctor or two providers, in that case, they may not need more than two or three FTEs.
Fareed Aziz: So it really depends who you, you know, target.
Fareed Aziz: And if you get a large organization, they need maybe 50 FTEs.
Fareed Aziz: So it all depends on the price of the client that you're targeting.
Liam Sheridan: Yeah, I'm just doing some quick maths here.
Liam Sheridan: again, please tell me if I'm wrong.
Liam Sheridan: We previously said five employees was about 150k revenue, and that's on the lower end, right?
Liam Sheridan: Bottom.
Liam Sheridan: So I'm just going to use that as the baseline.
Liam Sheridan: So 10 kind of employees would be 300k.
Liam Sheridan: If we're looking to double, we need another 2.1 million.
Liam Sheridan: So if I divide 2.1 million divided by 300k, that's seven clients.
Liam Sheridan: So we call it 14 on the base.
Liam Sheridan: So call it 14 clients you need across the year, right?
Liam Sheridan: That's what I'm forecasting as a rough estimate.
Liam Sheridan: That's about one or two a month, let's call it.
Fareed Aziz: And then in terms of your close rate on that, do you know what that is?
Fareed Aziz: So, so far, as I mentioned, it was all organic growth.
Liam Sheridan: if the client...
Liam Sheridan: it very different.
Fareed Aziz: We were able to, you know, so we didn't really have cases where we got on a call and we didn't have a result.
Fareed Aziz: So with that said, it could be different here.
Fareed Aziz: If someone is interested to get on a call to discuss a decision maker, not anyone in a position that may not be able to make a decision, they're already interested.
Fareed Aziz: They like the idea.
Fareed Aziz: They're interested.
Fareed Aziz: Now we just have to prove and get their confidence that we can make it happen because they already like the idea of the cost savings.
Fareed Aziz: So we need to cater to their needs and be able to quickly make that happen and hopefully also get a client referral that is not, you know, it is possible to make that happen as well.
Fareed Aziz: Provide them a referral so they feel comfortable.
Fareed Aziz: So it all really depends.
Fareed Aziz: I would say in a worst case, let's, let's go with 20% close rate.
Fareed Aziz: with 20%, 20%, let's let's go let's go go Thank
Fareed Aziz: So if you talk to 10, we were able to onboard two, sign a contract.
Fareed Aziz: So in that case, we're talking about, you said, what, 14 clients to be onboarded?
Fareed Aziz: So, yeah.
Liam Sheridan: 70 meetings over a year, call it 10 a month, I'd say, roughly.
Liam Sheridan: So if we could deliver 10 meetings a month, think you'd be pretty satisfied with that, right?
Liam Sheridan: And I know I've kind of asked you a lot of questions, so I will, let me go into what we do, because I know we've only got seven minutes here.
Liam Sheridan: We can book a follow-up call if we need to, but I know you're trying to make a decision quickly.
Liam Sheridan: So let me run you through our approach.
Liam Sheridan: I think we could definitely help you.
Liam Sheridan: I'll keep it kind of short and sweet, and then you can ask me questions on it.
Liam Sheridan: I think that's probably the best way to go about this due to the lack of time.
Liam Sheridan: So with our agency, we take a slightly different approach to most people.
Liam Sheridan: We do exercise number one, which is full-time mapping.
Liam Sheridan: So you said to me there around, you only want to speak to the people who can actually make a decision, right?
Liam Sheridan: So you would tell me who they are in terms of the audience?
Liam Sheridan: We'd have a call about it and what that looks like.
Liam Sheridan: So who are the decision makers?
Liam Sheridan: Then I'd go away and map out who are all of them across all of the people you want to speak to in the United States.
Liam Sheridan: OK, so let's say there's 100,000 of them for the sake of the numbers I'm about to say.
Liam Sheridan: Now, with that, you can normally get about 60% of them with email.
Liam Sheridan: OK, that's just like general statistics, email coverage.
Liam Sheridan: The rest you can't find an email for.
Liam Sheridan: They're not on LinkedIn or you just can't get an email.
Liam Sheridan: So we bridge that gap with cold calling and LinkedIn.
Liam Sheridan: Right.
Liam Sheridan: So we give you a full time coverage in terms of contacting every single person in your total adjustable market every 45 to 60 days is our goal.
Liam Sheridan: And I'll focus on email for a second.
Liam Sheridan: So what we're going to do is we're going to not send a seven, eight email sequence like most people.
Liam Sheridan: We're going to send one or two emails that has a relevant message to something that's relevant to right now.
Liam Sheridan: So it could be about the big, beautiful bill, like you mentioned.
Liam Sheridan: So this is coming in.
Liam Sheridan: Is now the right time to kind of explore an option with us?
Liam Sheridan: Then statistics.
Liam Sheridan: There's only 3% of the market ever really looking for a solution.
Liam Sheridan: And what most people will do is they'll look for triggers, for example.
Liam Sheridan: So they'll look for a hiring trigger for a hospital, which is obviously a key intent signal for you guys, because it's like, okay, they're hiring, they could just use us instead and save the money, right?
Liam Sheridan: Or open positions at a medical center, again, another key intent signal.
Liam Sheridan: But that's focusing on the 3% that's ready, rather than focus on 100%.
Liam Sheridan: So our approach is also doing that.
Liam Sheridan: But we're also going to email everyone else, because not everyone's going to be posting about it on social media.
Liam Sheridan: So we're going to use a message that's going to hit the right person at the right time, they're going to raise their hand, they're going to say, yeah, I'm interested in a meeting, we booked that meeting for you, we handle all responses up until the point we're on the phone with you.
Liam Sheridan: And then after 45 days, we're going to go out to that audience again.
Liam Sheridan: Okay, and because we only sent them one or two emails, they're not going to remember it, they probably may have deleted out of their inbox, it wasn't relevant to them at that time.
Liam Sheridan: But in the next 45 days, when it's crisis mode, and they need to...
Liam Sheridan: Reduced costs, and they're having a staffing shortage, and they need a solution.
Liam Sheridan: Now, we pop up, right message, right person, right time.
Liam Sheridan: So that's our approach is a little bit different to most people.
Liam Sheridan: But that's how I think we would get you at least 10 meetings a month, and kind of deliver consistently quarter over quarter.
Liam Sheridan: So it's not, okay, yeah, we get a load of meetings this month, and then, oh, no, then it tails off, tails off, tails off.
Liam Sheridan: Our approach is really simple.
Liam Sheridan: We're going to reach out to all of them every 45 to 60 days, and then try to get them on meetings with you.
Liam Sheridan: And we handled all replies and everything else up until the point they're on that meeting.
Liam Sheridan: So I'll let you ask any questions or anything.
Liam Sheridan: I know I went through that pretty quickly.
Fareed Aziz: Yeah, so I know we have four minutes left, but I could go 10 minutes over.
Fareed Aziz: But let me give you a quick...
Fareed Aziz: Give me two seconds.
Liam Sheridan: Let me check my calendar.
Liam Sheridan: I think I have a call.
Liam Sheridan: Yeah, I do have a call.
Liam Sheridan: But what I can do is I'll monitor my email.
Liam Sheridan: And if that person doesn't join, we can carry on.
Fareed Aziz: How does that sound?
Fareed Aziz: Yeah, that's fine.
Fareed Aziz: So what I'm looking for is a partner, business development partner.
Fareed Aziz: I'm for Thank
Fareed Aziz: Who would guarantee, right?
Fareed Aziz: There has to be some minimum guarantees of what you could bring to the table or work on a commission basis.
Fareed Aziz: So if it's a win-win, if we make money, you make money.
Fareed Aziz: So keep that in mind as you're thinking and discussing and coming up with a proposal that may make more sense.
Fareed Aziz: Because to me, partnership goes a long ways.
Fareed Aziz: I want it to be a long-term relationship since I did not have any marketing.
Fareed Aziz: Neither do I want to grow that internally.
Fareed Aziz: That's not my niche.
Fareed Aziz: I'm more of an operational guy.
Fareed Aziz: So I really need that partner who could really deliver.
Fareed Aziz: So that's something I will obviously keep in mind.
Fareed Aziz: The other piece, we're not after filling the positions for them more so.
Fareed Aziz: But every organization, no matter if they have 600,000 employees doing that work, they still have vendor partners already who are providing the services.
Fareed Aziz: They may not be happy with those services.
Fareed Aziz: So our goal is to approach in a way that we can reduce your vendor costs today Bye.
Fareed Aziz: you.
Fareed Aziz: the quality and reducing your cost.
Fareed Aziz: This is how we work.
Fareed Aziz: Because anytime when you challenge or go after the open positions or positions that they want to fill locally, political challenges come into play and they may not like the idea of losing those jobs, right?
Fareed Aziz: So unless if you're talking to CFO who is looking at a larger scale and they're looking into the overall budget, then that's a different conversation.
Fareed Aziz: But if I'm talking to a VP or a director, it's a totally different concept.
Fareed Aziz: Director may not resonate if you say, hey, instead of filling those positions, go with us.
Fareed Aziz: So there's many different ways we could address this.
Fareed Aziz: Probably in the next meeting, we can talk more about it.
Fareed Aziz: But what I'm really looking for, and I have a couple of partners that I've talked to, potential partners that I've talked to, who are confident to deliver results.
Fareed Aziz: And the contract is going to be based upon win-win scenario.
Fareed Aziz: So it'll be commission-based or contingent-based.
Fareed Aziz: So whatever you want to call it, if we close a deal, they get paid.
Fareed Aziz: There's a minimum that they will charge on a monthly basis, very minimum to cover their costs for marketing.
Fareed Aziz: But other than that, they actually profit when we profit.
Fareed Aziz: So those are the kind of models that I'm interested in.
Fareed Aziz: So if you could please put something together.
Fareed Aziz: I know you have some minimum guarantees.
Fareed Aziz: That's why I thought it's still worth a conversation.
Fareed Aziz: And if you're confident enough.
Fareed Aziz: Yeah, makes sense.
Liam Sheridan: Look, I don't want to cut you off.
Liam Sheridan: I know we've only got one minute here.
Liam Sheridan: But just to be fully transparent and honest with you, if you have got someone lined up, and they are going to do something on a rev share basis, then I would suggest going with them.
Liam Sheridan: It's going to be a very risk free approach for you.
Liam Sheridan: That's not something that's not how we operate, just to be completely honest.
Liam Sheridan: It is the sales process is outside of our control.
Liam Sheridan: So we just don't we can't rely on that as a business, right?
Liam Sheridan: We like to control the variables that are inside our control, which is why we go with the approach.
Liam Sheridan: Which we do.
Liam Sheridan: But I would recommend
Liam Sheridan: And going with the person who is going to do it on a rev share model.
Liam Sheridan: And then if it doesn't work out, you can come back to us and we can kind of revisit this conversation.
Liam Sheridan: And I know you said you were looking to kind of make a conversation before I emailed you.
Liam Sheridan: So maybe go with that one for now.
Liam Sheridan: And then we can revisit this if that doesn't work out.
Liam Sheridan: But that would be my recommendation for now, just to be completely honest with you, because I think that's too good to pass up.
Fareed Aziz: Yeah, so other piece that I probably, maybe the semantics, they guarantee the leads, the qualified leads.
Fareed Aziz: You can't control the sale that's on me, right?
Fareed Aziz: So as long as there's a guarantees of specific, who do we consider a qualified lead is?
Fareed Aziz: If he can be on the same page and the number of leads that you could get each month, where you could schedule those meetings, that's what I'm looking for from a partner.
Fareed Aziz: Yeah, makes sense.
Liam Sheridan: Makes sense.
Liam Sheridan: So yeah, we can continue that conversation.
Liam Sheridan: terms of qualification, just to cover it up, I have got this person's job on my other call.
Liam Sheridan: Two things.
Liam Sheridan: The qualification you would set, so you could say to me, Liam, I know it's expected.
Liam Sheridan: That's part of the onboarding process.
Liam Sheridan: You'll define it and we'll have a call and agree on that.
Liam Sheridan: Not a problem.
Liam Sheridan: In terms of guarantee, and if you're talking about a monthly guarantee, that's not something I'd look to do, just to be honest, because one month, if you said, I want 10 calls a month with qualified leads, I might do eight month one, 12 month two, and 15 month three.
Liam Sheridan: Or pick the number you want.
Liam Sheridan: And then if you say, Liam, you didn't deliver 10 calls in month one, I don't think that's very fair because we delivered it over the quarter.
Liam Sheridan: So if you're looking at a quarterly number, then yeah, potentially we can look at that and what that means for you and kind of how that ROI works out.
Liam Sheridan: That's absolutely fine.
Liam Sheridan: But I am going to have to drop, I'll drop you an email after this call.
Liam Sheridan: And we can continue conversation on email.
Liam Sheridan: If need to jump on another call, we can do that.
Liam Sheridan: But I appreciate your time, Fareed.
Liam Sheridan: I'll speak to you soon.
