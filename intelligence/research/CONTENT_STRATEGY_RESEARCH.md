### What Works on X (Cold Email Niche)

**Post Formats That Get Engagement:**
1. **Contrarian takes** - "Cold email is dead" (then explain why it's not)
2. **Specific numbers** - "I sent 50,000 emails. Here's what I learned"
3. **Templates/swipe files** - "Copy this exact email that books 12 meetings/month"
4. **Calling out bad practices** - "Stop doing this in your subject lines"
5. **Behind the scenes** - "Here's our exact tech stack for sending 2k/day"

**Style Notes (Matching Liam's Current Approach):**
- Lowercase ✓
- Short sentences ✓
- Line breaks between thoughts ✓
- Profanity when it hits ✓
- No emojis/hashtags ✓

**Optimal Posting Times:**
- 8am ET - catches morning scrollers
- 12pm ET - lunch break engagement
- 5pm ET - end of day wind-down
- (Already doing this ✓)

## 2. LinkedIn Strategy for B2B Lead Gen Founders

### Why LinkedIn Matters
- More professional audience = higher intent
- Decision makers actually use it
- Algorithm favors text posts (no link penalty like X)
- Comments drive massive reach

### Best Practices for Repurposing X → LinkedIn

**What to Change:**
- Remove profanity or soften ("fucking" → "absolutely")
- Add 1-2 sentences of context at the start
- Can be slightly longer (LinkedIn rewards 800-1200 character posts)
- Use line breaks generously (easy mobile reading)
- Add a question at the end to drive comments

**What to Keep:**
- Core insight/message
- Direct, no-BS tone
- Specific numbers and examples
- Personal experience

**Example Transformation:**

X Post:
```
your 6-email sequence is why no one replies

one email. maybe two.

that's it.

stop being annoying.
```

LinkedIn Version:
```
I've audited 50+ cold email sequences this year.

The pattern I see over and over:

6-8 emails per sequence.
Generic follow-ups.
Zero replies.

Here's the truth most agencies won't tell you:

One email. Maybe two. That's all you need.

If your first email doesn't get a response, sending 5 more won't magically fix it.

The problem isn't frequency. It's relevance.

What's your take - how many emails do you include in your sequences?
```

### Posting Frequency
- **Minimum:** 3x/week (Mon, Wed, Fri)
- **Optimal:** 5x/week (weekdays)
- **Best times:** 7-9am ET or 5-6pm ET

### Growth Tactics
1. **Comment on larger accounts** - Add value, not "great post!"
2. **Engage with your commenters** - Reply within 1 hour
3. **Tag relevant people** - When sharing insights about tools/companies
4. **Carousel posts** - Perform well for frameworks/lists
5. **Polls** - Easy engagement, algorithm loves them

## 3. YouTube Strategy for B2B

### What's Working in B2B YouTube

**Successful Formats:**
1. **Loom-style tutorials** - Face in corner + screen share
2. **Talking head with b-roll** - Simple but professional
3. **Whiteboard/slides** - Works for frameworks
4. **Case studies** - "How we booked 47 meetings for [Client]"

**Video Length Sweet Spots:**
- **5-8 minutes** - Tutorial/tactical (optimal for retention)
- **10-15 minutes** - Deep dives
- **2-3 minutes** - Shorts/clips for reach

### Thumbnail Best Practices
- Face with expression (surprise, curiosity)
- 3-5 words max
- High contrast colors
- Problem/number in text ("87% Fail" / "Hidden Trick")

### Title Formulas That Work
1. "How to [Outcome] Without [Pain Point]"
2. "Why [Common Practice] is Wrong"
3. "I [Did Thing]. Here's What Happened"
4. "[Number] [Things] That [Outcome]"
5. "Stop [Doing Thing] (Do This Instead)"

### Low-Effort YouTube Approach
Given Liam's time constraints:

1. **Batch record** - 3-4 videos in one 2-hour session
2. **Loom-style** - No editing needed, just trim start/end
3. **Repurpose newsletter content** - Each issue = 1 video script
4. **Upload weekly** - Saturday or Sunday
5. **Shorts from long videos** - Extract 60-sec clips

### Suggested First 5 Videos (Quick Wins)
1. "Your Cold Emails Land in Spam - Here's the Fix" (Infrastructure)
2. "Reach Your Entire Market Every 45 Days" (TAM Coverage)
3. "The 80-Word Cold Email" (Messaging)
4. "Intent Data is Dead" (Targeting)
5. "Stop Personalizing Cold Emails" (Contrarian)

## 4. Newsletter Growth Tactics

### Current State
- 50 subscribers from LinkedIn lead magnets
- 20 issues scheduled through April
- "Outbound That Works" brand

### Growth Path: 50 → 500 → 5000

**Phase 1: 50 → 500 (Next 60 days)**
1. **Lead magnet delivery** - Convert X engagement to email signups
2. **LinkedIn posts** - Add "I write about this weekly - link in comments"
3. **X bio link** - Direct to newsletter signup
4. **Guest on podcasts** - 2-3 appearances = 50-100 subs each
5. **Cross-promote** - Partner with complementary newsletters

**Phase 2: 500 → 2000 (90 days)**
1. **YouTube → Newsletter** - Every video mentions the newsletter
2. **Referral program** - "Forward to a friend" with incentive
3. **SparkLoop** - Paid recommendations from other newsletters
4. **Community engagement** - Skool, Slack groups, share content

**Phase 3: 2000 → 5000 (6 months)**
1. **SEO content** - Blog posts that rank, convert to email
2. **Paid ads** - LinkedIn/Meta if unit economics work
3. **Speaking** - Webinars, virtual events, conferences
4. **Tool partnerships** - Co-marketing with Apollo, Instantly, etc.

### Lead Magnet Optimization

Current lead magnets:
- BENCHMARK - Cold Email Benchmark Report
- CLAUDE - AI Research Copilot Breakdown
- TAM - Full TAM Coverage System
- INFRA - Infrastructure Breakdown

**Improvements:**
1. **Format as Notion docs** - Easy to share, looks professional
2. **Add email gate** - Require email to access (even if already following)
3. **Create dedicated landing pages** - Higher conversion than DM delivery
4. **A/B test keywords** - See which magnets drive most signups

## 5. Low-Effort High-Impact Ideas

### The 80/20 for Liam

Given limited time, focus on:

1. **X → LinkedIn repurposing** (30 min/week)
   - Take top 3 X posts from the week
   - Adapt for LinkedIn
   - Schedule via Buffer/Hootsuite

2. **Newsletter → YouTube** (2 hrs/month)
   - Record 4 videos in one session
   - Each video = one newsletter issue, verbalized
   - Loom-style, no editing

3. **Lead magnet automation** (One-time setup)
   - Create Notion pages for each magnet
   - Set up auto-DM via Phantombuster or manual template
   - Track which magnets convert best

4. **Weekly content batch** (Sunday, 1 hour)
   - Review what performed on X
   - Queue 5 LinkedIn posts
   - Reply to best comments
   - Check newsletter metrics

### Content Repurposing Workflow

```
Newsletter Issue (500 words)
    ↓
YouTube Video (5-7 min)
    ↓
YouTube Short (60 sec highlight)
    ↓
3 X Posts (key points)
    ↓
3 LinkedIn Posts (adapted X posts)
    ↓
1 Tweet thread (if topic warrants)
```

One newsletter = 10+ pieces of content

**Instantly** - Heavy content marketing, YouTube tutorials, community (Slack)
**Smartlead** - YouTube focused, technical deep-dives
