## STEP 1 VARIATIONS

### Variation 1 - Enrollment Journey
Subject: student enrollment at {COMPANY}

{FIRST_NAME}, what if prospective students at {COMPANY} could find their program and enroll without getting lost in your site?

We redesigned the enrollment journey for a 79,000-student college district and watched completion rates climb.

P.S. That district awarded over 10,000 degrees last year - their site finally keeps pace with demand.

### Variation 2 - Search/Navigation
Subject: site navigation question

Body:
{FIRST_NAME}, can students at {COMPANY} actually find what they're looking for on your website?

We rebuilt search and navigation for a major college district - made 350+ programs discoverable instead of buried.

P.S. After 10 years together, they still trust us with their digital experience.

### Variation 3 - Accessibility
Subject: accessibility and your site

Body:
{FIRST_NAME}, how confident is {COMPANY} in your website's accessibility compliance?

We made a 79,000-student district's site fully accessible - content, navigation, search, everything.

Would {COMPANY} benefit from a similar approach?

Worth a conversation for {COMPANY}?

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}

P.S. They've awarded over 10,000 degrees annually since we streamlined their enrollment journey.

### Variation 7 - Direct Value Question
Subject: your website working hard enough?

Body:
{FIRST_NAME}, is {COMPANY}'s website actually helping students enroll - or just getting in the way?

We've spent a decade making one college district's site do the heavy lifting: clear navigation, relevant search, accessible content.

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}

P.S. That district serves 79,000+ students. Their site finally keeps up.

## STEP 2 - FOLLOW-UP

Subject: Re: student enrollment at {COMPANY}

Body:
{FIRST_NAME}, wanted to bump this up in your inbox.

We've helped a major college district grow from a confusing site to a streamlined enrollment machine - 10,000+ degrees awarded last year.

If improving how students find and choose programs at {COMPANY} is on your radar, I'd love 15 minutes.
