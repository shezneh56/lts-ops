## Key Takeaways

### Current Status
- Response rates unexpectedly low
- 2,500 golden ICP accounts (Optimizely users - CMO, CTO, CIO roles)
- Enterprise security systems blocking cold email (Proofpoint, Mimecast, custom servers)
- Normal 1-2 email approach not working - TAM too small, clients too big

### New Strategy: Account-Based Marketing (ABM)
- Multi-threaded approach for 2,500 key accounts
- Day 1: Email
- Day 4: Email
- Day 5: Cold call ("did you see my email?")
- Then LinkedIn message
- Goal: Get touchpoints so they discuss C2 at coffee machine / boardroom

### Three Parallel Approaches
1. **ABM (Main Focus)**: 2,500 golden ICP with aged domains, multi-touch
2. **Competitor Testing**: Sitecore, Contentful users (NOT AEM - too locked in)
3. **Lookalikes**: 21 current C2 customers → find similar companies

### Alamo Colleges Case Study Angle
- Alamo can get more degree seekers in ONE semester than others get in 4 years
- 90,000 humans per semester - scaled EDU offering
- Community colleges becoming federalized = more budget
- Lookalikes approach: "Alamo Colleges achieved X. Would you like the case study?"
- Apollo search: 23,000 lookalike results for Alamo Colleges alone

### CMS Agnostic Tools (for Sitecore/Contentful users)
Drew to send list of Opti tools that work on any CMS:
- Opal (agentic)
- Experimentation
- Customer Marketing Platform (CMP)
- All designed to be CMS agnostic

### Workshop Offer
- Drew has refined workshop deck
- Can offer free workshop as value-add for foot in door
- Topics: AI governance, what do you want to do that you can't today

### Other Ideas
- M&A / company splits - change management opportunity
- Monitor Verndale, Huge (agencies) for intent signals
- Track LinkedIn engagement on Optimizely-related content

0:01 - Michael Kunzler II
  No more snow?

0:02 - Liam Sheridan (flarefinance.co.uk)
  It's been freezing.

0:03 - Michael Kunzler II
  No, we're still cold out. Stay with her.

0:06 - Liam Sheridan (flarefinance.co.uk)
  We're doing all right.

0:07 - Michael Kunzler II
  You're in the office today.

0:08 - Liam Sheridan (flarefinance.co.uk)
  It looks like a different background.

0:10 - Michael Kunzler II
  Yeah, in the office today. We just got a new position. It's basically a corollary to a chief operating officer. We call it the integrator in our EOS, which is like our business game plan, kind of. And she's new to the team, so I wanted to come in and meet her in person and everything. And it's just exciting to get some new driven leadership in that spot. It's going to be pretty useful for team, I think. So, yeah. How does that work then in terms of, because is Mike the CEO? Yes, he's the CEO. This is the COO. Oh, okay.

0:46 - Liam Sheridan (flarefinance.co.uk)
  So you've got like a chief operating officer coming in, right? exactly.

0:49 - Michael Kunzler II
  It's equivalent to that, I'd say, in most systems. So that's exciting. Definitely nice to have her on board and everything. And we're looking forward to seeing what we can do with her, definitely. Definitely. Yeah. Definitely.

1:00 - Liam Sheridan (flarefinance.co.uk)
  Interesting. Well, hopefully we can get the pipeline going with some deals, too. Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's the goal here. So, yeah, I don't know if I want to wait for Mike to join, but I'll make a start anyway. And I'm just going to be fully transparent with what's going on at the minute. So in terms of the response rates, it's been very low, right? Unexpectedly low in terms of what I'd initially expected. Now, there's a number of reasons behind that. Initially, I think I said to you last week that we had some issues with targeting, which is fine, and we fixed. And now I'm going back out to the companies who are, there's almost, if I'm being honest, 2,500 ICP accounts here, right, that you guys really want to speak to from Opti users who may or may not already have a partner, but they're the CMO, CTO, CIO guys, right? So that's the dream accounts list. That's the golden ICP, as you would say, right? So, full throttle on... Those 2,500 people, okay? If we can get any of them on the phone with you, then I think it's probably a pretty good chance of it being a decent conversation. They're already up to users. You guys are good at what you do. 2024 partner of year, that's big credibility. Now, the problem is getting a hold of these people, right? I'll be honest with you. It's a nightmare, okay? So a lot of these companies are like Fortune 500 or like close to that sort of size where they have crazy security systems in terms of cold email specifically, right, where they've got Proofpoint, Mimecast, another email server, which they'll all have custom servers basically where their job, especially the CTO or CIO or CISO, is to stop me emailing them, right? So I'm kind of fighting an uphill battle up against these guys. I think the next best thing is LinkedIn, okay? So, and then cold calling, of course, because people still answer their phone. So I think with email, I'm still going to use it. My plan is I've set up some new infrastructure for you guys. I've got some age domains that have been kind of running for multiple years that have good infrastructure health over a long period of time. And that's how you get into an enterprise inbox, right? So that's going to be kind of my goal to get these accounts warmed up, get them going, and then get into those enterprise inboxes and get these deals with these kind of guys going, right? So that's goal one. So email the kind of dream 2,500, let's call it. Now that approach, just to be honest, is different from our normal approach. What we would normally do is, and I think Drew, when we went through the initial proposal, I think we estimated the TAM to be in the 30,000 range of optimizer users. think we said, and I think we said it was optimistic, maybe cut it in half to 15. We said there was like 2,000 to 5,000 companies using it, maybe three to five decision makers in each. I think that was the math we did. We said, yeah, look, these guys are going to hear who we're going after. Now there is five. 5,000 companies using Optimizely. There's not that many in the US. There's probably, I think, in my dream accounts list of actual companies, I've got maybe 500 to 1,000. Then you look at the job roles that are relevant for that, and I've filtered out with AI all the crap. So, for example, any job roles that aren't relevant, basically, I can't think of one off the top of my head. So my plan with those accounts is a multi-threaded ABM approach. So what we would normally do is we would send a one or two email sequence. We would try and see if anyone's interested. And then we would kind of put them onto a call. Now, that's not going to work here. There's too little accounts for us to take that approach. So what we are going to do, and I've kind of got set up and planned now, is account-based marketing, which basically means our goal now with these 2,500 accounts, and I'm going to come on to other stuff as well, is to just get a touch point. And the idea here is the way that it kind of works is in an enterprise company, right? We're probably never going to get the CTO to just book a call out of blue from a cold email. It's just not going to happen, right? Especially when that... Guy's kind of job is to stop the cold emails coming in anyway. But anyway, so what we need to do, and this is my kind of plan with the multi-threading ABM style, is I want to have a touchpoint with an email with him. I want to have a touchpoint with an email with a CMO. I want to get the kind of head of brand, the digital experience guy, just touchpoint. It's just here's an email that they see, and they see the C2 Group's email with me. Then when they go to the coffee machine or go into a boardroom, they go, did you get an email from C2 the other day? And then have a conversation about it, and then we get that internal conversation going. Now, that's going to take a couple of weeks at least in order for us to kind of start moving that, and it's a test to see how it works, right? So that's kind of my plan with that. Cold calling, LinkedIn, and email for a multi-threaded approach across 2,500 key accounts. Now, to be honest with you, I wasn't doing this for the past two weeks. I was trying what we normally do, one to two emails, testing kind of responses. We weren't guessing any, right? And if we did initially, it was the wrong person. We changed that. Now, the responses are next to zero, and I think it's just because of this. So aged accounts, ABM, 2,500 accounts. Now, what I am going to do, and this is some of the other things, is I'll be able to get way more people who are using Sitecore, who are using Adobe Experience Manager, for example. Now, that is obviously a kind of touchy one where people may not switch from Adobe Experience Manager, but it could be worth trying anyway. And any other kind of competitors of Optimizely, what that does is, and this is just testing grounds, right? The ABM is the main focus here. The other things are just like, I'm going to give it a go and see if we can get some conversations to go, maybe get someone to switch onto the platform. That's how I'm going to just test with the emails that aren't the aged ones, that are kind of newer ones, and we're going to just email these Sitecore users, email these Adobe Experience Manager users, any other content for things like this. That's the plan with them. Just testing, seeing if we can get some responses, see if we can get some calls booked. Same with the DMFS list, right? See if we can get some calls booked, test with those guys, see if we can kind of get them onto a call with you. And even... Just get some kind of conversations going for a potential deal, right? That's the goal here. And then the third kind of point I'm thinking about here, and please kind of analyze everything I'm saying and provide me feedback and say, Liam, that's a waste of time or not. The third approach here is you gave me a list of 21 current clients for C2, either two weeks ago, maybe a week ago. So my thought process is there's a number of different industries there and a number of different companies. There's some kind of common ones like education, kind of financial services, healthcare, tech being probably the main four, right? I'm thinking if I find lookalikes for the companies, so let's take Alamel Colleges is one that I was looking at earlier, or even is it Central Bank, believe? They're two of the ones I was using as a test. I can get a number of lookalike accounts for those, and it will be scored to say, like, this is 90, this is 95, this is 99, right? Depending on the kind of size and everything else. into a revenue number of employees. My thought process is, if I go out to a lookalike company, and I can take Alamo College as an example, and say to, and Mike says, I'm just going to accept him in. We are helping, we helped Alamo Colleges get this result. Would you like me to send you the case study from the website? And we just send it to them. That could be a way for us to generate interest from those people who are lookalike companies where they go, well, why are they doing it as a competitor, or even a similar business, or even someone who's like us? I want to do the same. That's my thought process. Now, Mike, I'll catch you up with everything I've just said in a minute, in a short version, but Drew, Michael, what do you guys think of what I just said, and in terms of, like, that approach? Am I missing the mark here, or does that sound, like, Sounds pretty reasonable to me.

8:57 - Drew Babik (The C2 Group)
  Yeah.

9:00 - Michael Kunzler II
  The working within the constraints here, because it definitely does seem like a difficult task in that sense, but that adaption along the way is definitely what we got to do, I think.
