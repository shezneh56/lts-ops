## CHECKPOINT 5: CAMPAIGN COPY

### STEP 1 VARIATIONS (10 Total)

---

#### Variation 1: Publishing Bottleneck (D2C Focus)
**Subject:** {FIRST_NAME} - content bottleneck at {COMPANY}?

{FIRST_NAME},

Quick question: how many engineering hours does {COMPANY} burn each month on content updates that should be self-serve?

Most D2C teams we talk to say their content crew is constantly waiting on dev tickets just to change a banner or launch a campaign page.

Hygraph flips that. Content team gets full control, your engineers get their time back.

Worth a 15-min look?

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}

P.S. - One retail brand cut their content deployment time from 2 weeks to same-day after switching.

---

#### Variation 2: Data Silos / Integration (Architecture Focus)
**Subject:** unifying {COMPANY}'s content stack

{FIRST_NAME},

Guessing {COMPANY} has content scattered across a PIM, DAM, maybe a legacy CMS or two?

Hygraph's content federation pulls it all into one GraphQL API. No migration headaches, no rip-and-replace. Your existing systems stay, you just get one unified content layer on top.

Curious if that maps to what you're dealing with?

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}

P.S. - This is the main reason enterprise teams pick us over Contentful.

---

#### Variation 3: Speed to Market (Product Focus)
**Subject:** launching faster at {COMPANY}

{FIRST_NAME},

How long does it take {COMPANY} to spin up a new microsite or launch in a new market?

For most product teams, the answer is "way too long" - usually because content infrastructure becomes the bottleneck.

Hygraph customers typically go from quarters to weeks. Same team, same budget, just better architecture.

Open to a quick walkthrough?

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}

P.S. - Happy to share how a similar-sized brand in your space did it.

---

#### Variation 4: AEM Migration (Enterprise Focus)
**Subject:** {FIRST_NAME} - AEM alternative

{FIRST_NAME},

If {COMPANY} is on Adobe AEM, you probably already know the pain: expensive licenses, slow customization, developer friction.

A lot of enterprise teams are moving to headless. Hygraph gives you the content federation capabilities you need without the AEM baggage.

Worth exploring before your next renewal?

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}

P.S. - We can usually cut implementation time in half compared to AEM projects.

---

#### Variation 5: Multi-Brand (Digital Leadership Focus)
**Subject:** content across {COMPANY}'s brands

{FIRST_NAME},

Managing content for multiple brands usually means multiple tools, multiple teams, and zero consistency.

Hygraph gives you one platform for all of it - shared components where it makes sense, brand-specific flexibility where it doesn't.

Is {COMPANY} dealing with multi-brand content complexity right now?

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}

P.S. - Most multi-brand enterprises see a 40 percent reduction in duplicate content work.

---

#### Variation 6: Developer Experience (Engineering Focus)
**Subject:** {FIRST_NAME} - GraphQL-native CMS

{FIRST_NAME},

If your engineering team dreads working with your current CMS, they're not alone.

Hygraph is GraphQL-native from the ground up. No REST workarounds, no proprietary SDKs, no vendor lock-in. Your devs actually enjoy using it.

Could be worth a look for {COMPANY}?

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}

P.S. - Our API documentation usually gets compliments from engineering teams. Rare for a CMS.

---

#### Variation 7: Gaming Industry Specific
**Subject:** {FIRST_NAME} - content ops for games

{FIRST_NAME},

Game studios have unique content challenges - live ops updates, localization across dozens of languages, content that needs to hit multiple platforms simultaneously.

Hygraph handles all of it through one API. Your content team can push updates without waiting on a build cycle.

Relevant for what {COMPANY} is working on?

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}

P.S. - Several major game publishers use Hygraph for their live content operations.

---

#### Variation 8: Hospitality Industry Specific
**Subject:** {FIRST_NAME} - omnichannel content at {COMPANY}

{FIRST_NAME},

Hotels and hospitality brands need content flowing to websites, apps, kiosks, booking engines - all from one source.

Hygraph is built for exactly that. One content hub, every channel gets what it needs through the API.

Is omnichannel content delivery on {COMPANY}'s roadmap?

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}

P.S. - Happy to share how hospitality brands are using this.

---

#### Variation 9: Manufacturing / B2B Focus
**Subject:** {FIRST_NAME} - product content at {COMPANY}

{FIRST_NAME},

Manufacturing companies usually have product data in an ERP, marketing content in a CMS, and specs in PDFs somewhere. Getting it all to work together is a nightmare.

Hygraph federates content from all your sources into one API. Your product pages, configurators, and dealer portals all pull from the same truth.

Sound like something {COMPANY} could use?

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}

P.S. - Manufacturers typically see a 50 percent reduction in content update time.

---

#### Variation 10: Wordpress Migration
**Subject:** {FIRST_NAME} - scaling past Wordpress

{FIRST_NAME},

Wordpress works until it doesn't. Usually that breaking point comes when you need real multi-site, serious integrations, or actual performance at scale.

A lot of teams at {COMPANY}'s size end up moving to headless. Hygraph makes that migration straightforward - keep your content structure, lose the Wordpress limitations.

Worth a conversation?

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}

P.S. - We've helped dozens of teams make this exact transition.

---

### STEP 2 (Follow-up)

**Subject:** Re: {ORIGINAL_SUBJECT}

{FIRST_NAME},

Wanted to bump this to the top of your inbox.

If content infrastructure isn't a priority right now, no worries - just let me know and I'll close the loop.

But if {COMPANY} is dealing with any of these:
- Content team bottlenecked by engineering
- Multiple systems that don't talk to each other
- Slow time-to-market for new digital experiences

Then a quick 15-minute call might save you months of pain later.

Either way, appreciate you reading this far.
