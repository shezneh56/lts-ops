## What's Working

### 1. EU Market — Better Engagement
- 1.51% reply rate vs 0.54% USA
- **EU startups more receptive** to agency outreach
- Less competition from US agencies

### 2. Very Early Stage (1-2 employees)
- 2.19% reply rate — highest
- 0.091% interest rate — 3x better than average
- **Founders at ideation stage need dev help**
- They're actively looking

### 3. Small is Working (Contrary to Other Clients)
- Unlike LegalSoft/Wow24-7, small companies work here
- Makes sense: startups need external dev, enterprises have teams

---

## What's NOT Working

### 1. USA Corporates — Low Conversion
- 14,323 sent → 2 interested (0.014%)
- 0.50% reply rate — lowest
- Corporates have internal dev teams
- **Wrong ICP for this service**

### 2. Crunchbase USA Campaigns
- 10,367 sent → 1 interested
- 0.37% reply rate
- Crunchbase data may be stale/poor quality

### 3. High Volume, Low Conversion Pattern
- 38k to USA → 8 interested
- 13k to EU → 4 interested
- **Volume doesn't equal results** — EU is more efficient

## Key Insights

### ICP Sweet Spot
| Segment | Works? | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| 1-2 employees (Founders) | ✅ YES | Need dev help, no team |
| 3-20 employees | ⚠️ MAYBE | Hit or miss |
| Corporates | ❌ NO | Have internal teams |
| EU over USA | ✅ YES | Less competition |

### Geographic Efficiency
- EU: 1 interested per 3,320 sent
- USA: 1 interested per 4,787 sent
- **EU is 44% more efficient**

### Stage Targeting
- Focus on pre-seed / seed stage
- Avoid Series B+ (they're hiring, not outsourcing)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate
1. **Shift volume from USA Corporates to EU startups**
2. **Increase 1-2 employee segment** — best converter
3. **Pause USA Crunchbase campaigns** — poor ROI

### Strategic
1. **EU should be primary market** — 44% more efficient
2. **Target founders at earliest stages** — they need outsourced dev
3. **Avoid corporates entirely** — wrong ICP

### Copy Considerations
1. Pain points: Can't find developers, need to ship fast, limited runway
2. Early-stage founders respond to speed and flexibility messaging
3. Don't oversell — founders are skeptical

## Questions to Answer

1. What's the copy difference between EU 1-2 and USA Corporates?
2. Can we get more EU early-stage leads?
3. Should Crunchbase be abandoned as a data source?
4. Are there specific verticals (fintech, healthtech) that convert better?
