## Universal Patterns

### What Works Everywhere
1. **Google leads > MS leads** (5-10x better)
2. **UK/EU > USA** (2-6x better conversion)
3. **Enrichment/Personalization** adds 30-50% lift
4. **Mid-market company size** (varies by client)

### What Fails Everywhere
1. **MS leads** — 0.16-0.18% reply rates, 0 interested
2. **Very large companies** — long cycles, no response
3. **Generic "Quick Question" copy** — fingerprinted
4. **Wrong ICP** — generates "wrong person" replies
