## What's Working

### 1. CyberSecurity EMEA — Top Performer
- 8 interested from ~19k sent (0.042%)
- **3x better than US cybersecurity**
- EMEA cybersecurity buyers more receptive
- Less competition from US agencies?

### 2. Google Leads — Massive Outperformance
- Google: 1.00% reply rate, 12 interested
- MS: 0.16% reply rate, 0 interested
- **Google is 6x better on replies, infinitely better on interested**

### 3. Real Estate UK — Small but Promising
- Only 1,000 sent but 2.60% reply rate
- 1 interested (0.10% rate — highest)
- May be worth expanding

---

## What's NOT Working

### 1. MS Leads — Complete Waste
- 22,203 sent → 35 replies → 0 interested
- **0.16% reply rate** — essentially spam
- Every MS campaign fails across all clients
- **Eliminate from all CGS campaigns**

### 2. SaaS/MVP Campaigns — Struggling
- 39,054 sent → only 2 interested (0.005%)
- "Quick question" copy getting fingerprinted
- Company size 1-10 employees is too small
- MVP/early-stage companies don't have budget for UX consulting

### 3. Crunchbase Campaigns — Zero Interested
- All Crunchbase MVP campaigns: 0 interested
- The data quality or targeting is off
- Startups on Crunchbase may be too early stage

### 4. US CyberSecurity — Underperforming
- 4 interested vs 8 in EMEA
- From more volume (26k vs 19k)
- US market more competitive

## Key Insights

### Vertical Priority
| Vertical | Priority | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| CyberSecurity EMEA | 1st | Best conversion, untapped |
| CyberSecurity US | 2nd | Still works, more volume |
| Real Estate UK | 3rd | Small test but promising |
| SaaS/MVP | Deprioritize | Not converting |

### Lead Source Mandate
- **ONLY use Google leads**
- MS is a complete failure
- Other sources are marginal

### Company Size
- 5-200 employees works for cybersecurity
- 1-10 (MVP/startups) doesn't work
- Enterprise may be worth testing

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate
1. **Kill all MS lead campaigns** — 0% ROI proven
2. **Pause all SaaS/MVP campaigns** — not working
3. **Increase CyberSecurity EMEA volume** — best performer

### Strategic
1. **CyberSecurity is the winning vertical** — double down
2. **EMEA > US** for this client
3. **Explore Real Estate UK** — promising early signal

### Copy for SaaS/MVP (if resuming)
1. Current copy is too generic
2. Need more specific pain points (site speed, conversion, mobile)
3. Company size filter: minimum 11 employees
4. Consider different angle: case studies with named companies

---

## Questions to Answer

1. Why does CyberSecurity EMEA convert 3x better than US?
2. Is the messaging resonating differently, or is it market competition?
3. Should SaaS/MVP vertical be abandoned entirely?
4. Can Real Estate UK be scaled up?
