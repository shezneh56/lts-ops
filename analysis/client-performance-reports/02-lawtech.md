## What's Working

### 1. UK Market — 6x Better Conversion Than USA
- UK: 0.064% interest rate
- USA: 0.011% interest rate
- **UK converts 6x better** per email sent

### 2. EU Market — 3x Better Than USA
- EU: 0.034% interest rate
- Still significantly outperforms USA

### 3. "Catch All" Campaigns — Highest Reply Rates
- UK Catch All: 3.90% reply rate
- EU Catch All: 3.32% reply rate
- These are likely broader targeting that catches interested parties
- Lower volume but higher engagement

### 4. GC/Legal Ops Targeting
- Legal Ops leaders are the right ICP
- They own the tech stack decisions
- Pain point (LawTech fatigue) resonates

---

## What's NOT Working

### 1. USA Market — Oversaturated
- 74,834 sent to USA → only 9 interested (0.012%)
- **USA GC market is flooded** with LegalTech vendors
- Every legal tech company is emailing these people
- Reply rate okay (1.13%) but conversions are low

### 2. In-House Lawyers Segment
- Both USA and EU versions underperform
- 1 interested each from 9-10k sent
- "In-House Lawyers" is too broad — not decision makers for tech

### 3. Volume in Wrong Markets
- 71% of volume going to USA (worst performer)
- Only 8% going to UK (best performer)
- **Inverse of what it should be**

---

## Key Insights

### Geographic Strategy
| Market | Current Volume | Should Be | Action |
|--------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| USA | 71% | 30-40% | Reduce |
| EU | 21% | 35-40% | Increase |
| UK | 8% | 25-30% | Increase significantly |

### ICP Refinement
- **KEEP:** GC, Legal Ops, Head of Legal
- **DEPRIORITIZE:** Generic "In-House Lawyers"
- **COMPANY SIZE:** 200-5000 employees (has legal ops function)

### Copy Implications
- USA needs fresh angles — "LawTech Fatigue" may be overused there
- UK/EU can continue with current messaging
- "Catch all" copy may have something worth extracting

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate
1. **Shift volume from USA to UK/EU** — 3-6x better conversion
2. **Pause In-House Lawyers campaigns** — wrong ICP level
3. **Increase UK GC/Legal Ops volume** — best performer

### Strategic
1. **Accept USA is a harder market** — saturated, needs different approach
2. **EU/UK should be primary markets** — less competition
3. **Consider USA only for enterprise (5000+)** — differentiate by going upmarket

### Copy for USA
1. Current "Fatigue" angle is burned
2. Try: Compliance angle, AI/automation angle, cost reduction angle
3. More specific proof points (case studies with named companies if possible)

## Questions to Answer

1. Why does UK convert 6x better? Less competition or better ICP fit?
2. What's in the "catch all" copy that gets 3.9% reply rate?
3. Should USA be deprioritized entirely for this client?
4. Would going upmarket (enterprise only) in USA help?
