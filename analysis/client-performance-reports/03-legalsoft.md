## What's Working

### 1. Google Leads — Best Quality
- 2.87% reply rate — highest by far
- Likely more accurate contact data
- Better targeting (Google knows intent)

### 2. Mid-Sized Firms (6-50 attorneys)
- This is the sweet spot
- Big enough to need help, small enough to not have in-house HR
- Decision maker is accessible (managing partner)

### 3. Enriched Campaigns Generate Volume
- 63k sent with enrichment
- Not dramatically higher conversion but enables personalization
- First-line personalization adds engagement lift

### 4. "No Enrichment" v2 — Surprising Performance
- 0.027% interest rate — better than enriched
- Simpler may be working
- Worth investigating the copy difference

---

## What's NOT Working

### 1. MS (Microsoft) Leads — Complete Failure
- 8,737 sent → 16 replies → 0 interested
- **0.18% reply rate** — essentially zero
- MS leads are garbage for this segment
- **Kill immediately**

### 2. Solo Practices (1-5 attorneys)
- 2,709 sent → 0 interested
- Higher reply rate (2.07%) but all negative
- Solo attorneys can't afford outsourced staff
- **Wrong ICP**

### 3. Large Enrichment Campaign — Paused
- 61,129 sent (massive) → 8 interested → 0.013% rate
- List may be burned/exhausted
- Pause is correct decision

## Key Insights

### Lead Source Hierarchy
| Source | Priority | Reply Rate | Action |
|--------|----------|------------|--------|
| Google | 1st | 2.87% | Increase |
| Apollo | 2nd | 1.34% | Maintain |
| Other | 3rd | 1.95% | Test more |
| MS | KILL | 0.18% | Eliminate |

### Firm Size Matters
- **6-50 attorneys:** Sweet spot — has budget, needs help
- **1-10:** Marginal — test carefully
- **1-5 (Solo):** Not viable — no budget

### Enrichment ROI
- Enrichment adds effort but marginal lift in this case
- Consider: Is the personalization worth the Clay cost?
- Non-enriched v2 performing similarly

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate
1. **Eliminate all MS lead campaigns** — 0% ROI
2. **Pause Solo practice campaigns** — wrong ICP
3. **Increase Google lead volume** — best performer

### Strategic
1. **Focus exclusively on 6-50 attorney firms**
2. **Test non-enriched vs enriched** — enrichment may not be worth it here
3. **Consider Apollo as primary source** if Google volume is limited

### Copy
1. Copy refreshed already (steps 2046, 2062, 2085) — monitor performance
2. Key angles: Case overflow, intake capacity, scaling without local hires
3. Proof point: Dallas PI firm, 300 cases in 4 months

## Questions to Answer

1. Why do Google leads perform so much better? Can we get more?
2. Is enrichment worth the cost given similar conversion rates?
3. Should we test 10-20 attorney firms as middle ground?
4. Are there specific practice areas (PI, family law) that convert better?
