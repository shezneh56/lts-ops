## What's Working

### 1. Professional Services Vertical
- **Prof Services - CRO - US** has **4.25% reply rate** — exceptional
- This audience (professional services companies) understands the value of outsourced appointment setting
- They're already buying services, so selling services to them makes sense

### 2. Tech B2B Vertical
- **Tech B2B - CRO - US** generates 34 interested at 2.22% reply rate
- CROs at tech companies are pain-aware about pipeline

### 3. "Old" Campaigns Outperforming V5
- Old campaigns: 4.25% (Prof Services), 2.22% (Tech B2B), 1.91% (VC/PE)
- V5 campaigns: 1.09-1.21%
- **Something in the V5 copy is weaker** — needs investigation

---

## What's NOT Working

### 1. VC/PE Segment — 0 Interested
- Despite 13k+ sent and decent reply rates (1.16-2.88%)
- Replies are likely "not interested" or "wrong person"
- **VC/PE may not be the right ICP** for LTS services
- Hypothesis: They have internal BD teams and don't outsource

### 2. Cyber Sales V5 — Low Everything
- 0.91% reply rate, 0 interested
- Small volume (2,539 sent) but concerning trend
- May need different messaging for security buyers

### 3. Marketing Campaigns (MKT vs SALES)
- LTS-FIN-MKT: 0 interested from 5,603 sent
- LTS-SAAS-MKT: 0 interested from 1,471 sent
- **Marketing leaders may not be decision makers** for appointment setting

---

## Key Insights

### ICP Refinement
- **KEEP:** CROs, VPs Sales at SaaS, Tech, Professional Services
- **DROP/PAUSE:** VC/PE segment, Marketing leaders
- **COMPANY SIZE:** 50-5000 works, avoid very small startups

### Copy Analysis Needed
Why are "old" campaigns outperforming V5?
- Old campaigns have different subject lines?
- Different proof points?
- Different opening angles?

**Action:** Pull copy from "Prof Services - CRO - US - old" and compare to V5

### Geographic
- US is primary market
- UK VC/PE not converting — consider pausing UK entirely or testing different verticals

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate
1. **Pause VC/PE campaigns** — not converting despite volume
2. **Pause Marketing (MKT) campaigns** — wrong ICP
3. **Analyze Prof Services copy** — understand why 4.25% reply rate

### Strategic
1. **Double down on Prof Services vertical** — expand list, increase volume
2. **Investigate V5 vs Old copy differences** — something changed
3. **Test UK with SaaS/Tech** — not VC/PE

### Copy
1. Extract winning elements from Prof Services campaign
2. Apply to V5 campaigns
3. Focus on pain points specific to each vertical

## Questions to Answer

1. What's different about the Prof Services copy that gets 4.25%?
2. Why did V5 campaigns not match old campaign performance?
3. Is VC/PE segment fundamentally wrong, or just the copy?
4. Should UK be a priority market or deprioritized?
