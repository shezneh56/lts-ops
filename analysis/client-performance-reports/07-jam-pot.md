|----------|------|---------|-----|---------|--------|

## What's Working

### 1. SaaS Vertical — Only Converter
- All 4 interested came from SaaS campaign
- 1.13% reply rate is respectable
- Copy was just refreshed (step 4014)

### 2. Right ICP Concept
- SaaS companies with ops chaos is valid pain point
- Founders/COOs wearing too many hats

---

## What's NOT Working

### 1. IT Services Campaign — Zero Interested
- 2,590 sent → 0 interested
- 0.93% reply rate but no conversions
- IT Services companies may already have ops figured out

### 2. Low Volume Overall
- Only 16,783 total sent
- Hard to draw strong conclusions
- Need more data

### 3. Single Market (USA only)
- No geographic diversification
- Could EU/UK SaaS companies be a better fit?

## Key Insights

### Vertical Clarity
- SaaS: Works (0.028% interest rate)
- IT Services: Doesn't work (0%)
- **Focus on SaaS only**

### Copy Assessment
- Just refreshed step 4014 with new angles
- Added spintax (was 0 before)
- Added pain points: calendar, CRM, vendor coordination
- Added proof point: 20+ hours saved per week
- **Need to monitor post-refresh performance**

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate
1. **Continue SaaS campaign** — only thing working
2. **Keep IT Services paused** — not converting
3. **Monitor copy refresh impact** — step 4014 just updated

### Strategic
1. **Increase SaaS volume** — need more data
2. **Test UK/EU SaaS** — geographic expansion
3. **Consider company size refinement** — 11-50 vs 50-200

### Copy
1. New copy emphasizes specific pain points (not generic "ops support")
2. Observation angle: "noticed something working with SaaS companies"
3. Proof in P.S.: 20+ hours saved

## Questions to Answer

1. Is 16k sent enough to draw conclusions?
2. What's the minimum viable company size for ops assistant need?
3. Should we test UK/EU market?
4. What happened to the original campaigns (before V3)?
