**Key Insights - LTS:**
- **Prof Services - CRO - US** has 4.25% reply rate — exceptional. WHY? Likely targeting pain-aware audience
- **Tech B2B - CRO** generates 34 interested at 2.22% reply — strong vertical
- V5 campaigns are performing but haven't overtaken old campaigns in interest conversion
- **VC/PE campaigns (US Sales Leaders, UK Sales Leaders)** — 0 interested despite decent reply rates. Copy may need work

**Recommendation:** 
- Analyze what's different about Prof Services and Tech B2B copy vs V5 campaigns
- VC/PE segment may not be the right ICP for LTS services

## Strategic Patterns

### What's Working

1. **Professional Services ICP** — 4.25% reply rate (LTS Prof Services)
2. **UK/EU Markets** — Higher conversion than US across multiple clients
3. **Enriched/Personalized Campaigns** — 5.02% (Wow24-7), 2.87% (LegalSoft Google)
4. **Cybersecurity Vertical** — 8 interested from EMEA (CGS)
5. **Mid-sized Companies (6-200 employees)** — Sweet spot across all clients
6. **Google Leads** — Consistently outperform MS leads

### What's Not Working

1. **MS (Microsoft) Leads** — 0.08-0.18% reply rates across all workspaces
2. **Solo/Very Small Companies (1-5)** — Low engagement, not decision makers
3. **Large Corporates (5000+)** — Low reply rates, long sales cycles
4. **USA GC/Legal Market** — Oversaturated, declining performance
5. **Generic "Quick Question" Copy** — Getting fingerprinted fast

### Drivers of Success

| Factor | Impact | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Geography (UK/EU vs US) | +50-100% | LawTech, CGS, Paralect |
| Lead Source (Google vs MS) | +300-500% | CGS, LegalSoft |
| Enrichment/Personalization | +30-50% | Wow24-7, LegalSoft |
| Company Size (Sweet Spot) | +20-40% | 6-200 employees |
| Vertical Specificity | +40-60% | CyberSecurity, Prof Services |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Resume Wow24-7 Enriched US Campaign** — 5.02% reply rate, paused but performing
2. **Increase CGS CyberSecurity EMEA Volume** — Best performer in that workspace
3. **Pause/Retire MS Lead Campaigns** — Wasting budget across all workspaces
4. **Expand LawTech UK/EU** — 2x better than USA

### Strategic Shifts

1. **Prioritize EU/UK Markets** — Consistently higher engagement
2. **Implement Clay ICP Validation** — Reduce "wrong person" replies
3. **Use Pain Point Personalization** — Add {PAIN_POINT} variable from Clay
4. **Focus on Mid-Market (6-200)** — Avoid solos and enterprises

### Copy Insights

1. **Prof Services 4.25% Formula** — What makes this copy work? Analyze and replicate
2. **Enriched Campaigns Work** — First-line personalization adds significant lift
3. **Avoid Generic Openers** — "Quick question" is being fingerprinted
4. **Proof Points Matter** — P.S. with specific stats outperforms generic
