# 2026-01-29 — Daily Report System & Workflow Automation

## Major Work Completed

### 1. Client Performance Reports Created
Built comprehensive analysis for all 11 workspaces at `/root/clawd/analysis/client-performance-reports/`:
- **00-overview.md** — Rankings & universal patterns
- Individual reports for LTS, LawTech, LegalSoft, CGS, Wow24-7, Paralect, Jam Pot
- **08-zero-interested-clients.md** — Gestell, C2, Hygraph, Med Virtual

### 2. Key Findings from Analysis
- **MS leads fail everywhere** — 0.16-0.18% reply, 0 interested
- **UK/EU outperforms USA** — 2-6x better conversion across clients
- **Google leads >> Apollo** — 2.87% vs 1.34% reply for LegalSoft
- **Wow24-7 Enriched US** — 5.02% reply rate but ARCHIVED (needs unarchive)
- **Company size matters** — mid-market (varies by client) beats extremes

### 3. C2 Experience Campaigns Uploaded
Created steps for campaigns 776-778 using EmailBison API:
- **776**: Central Bank — 8 steps (7 variants + follow-up)
- **777**: CCC Nebraska — 8 steps (7 variants + follow-up)  
- **778**: Certinia — 8 steps (7 variants + follow-up)

- Pause/archive campaigns per action plan
- Unarchive Wow24-7 Enriched US
- Shift geographic focus (USA → UK/EU)
