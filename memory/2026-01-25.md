## First Contact
- Met Liam — runs lead gen agency, cold outbound work
- Based in Spain, CET timezone
- Set up basic identity files
- Approach: iterate and improve over time, no need to nail everything on day one

## Setup
- Created USER.md, IDENTITY.md, memory/ directory
- Ready to start building

## WhatsApp Setup
- Initially linked +447716953711
- Switched to +16462940798 (US number)
- Both numbers now in allowlist

## Business Context
- Liam runs **Leads That Show** (leadsthat.show)
- Cold outbound appointment setting for enterprise clients
- ~10 clients, mainly cold email campaigns
- Moving upmarket from performance-based to enterprise positioning
- Key needs: prioritization, campaign effectiveness, operational efficiency

## Deep Dive Session
- Captured full business overview (see business-overview.md)
- Main bottlenecks: too much time on campaign setup, not enough on sales
- Critical: C2 Group renewal mid-Feb ($12.5k)
- Goal: $100k/month in Q1
- Need to build: sales follow-up automation, campaign assistance, inbox monitoring

## Systems Built Today
✅ Gmail API integration (liam@leadsthat.show access, warmup filtered: p0zfhi2t)
✅ Call tracker monitoring (Google Sheet sync)
✅ Daily WhatsApp alerts (8 AM CET) - urgent actions, follow-ups, HOT leads
✅ Calendly integration (tracking bookings)
✅ Fathom credentials stored

## New Workflow Requested
- When call booked → Remind Liam to send voice note (doesn't need me to send, he'll do it)
- Reminder cadence:
  - Immediate: "Send voice note to [Name]"
  - 11 PM CET if not done
  - 9 AM prospect's timezone if still not done
- No iMessage automation needed (Liam sends manually)

## Deep Dive #2 - Ideal Week & Task List
- Captured ideal week structure (see ideal-workflow.md)
- Identified cost-cutting opportunities: $5,960/mo potential savings
  - Mary (inbox): $5,160/mo → AI reply agent
  - Sharia (campaigns): $800/mo → AI automation
- Built prioritized task list (see PRIORITY-TASKS.md)
- Cash flow tight - Feb 15 payment decision urgent

## Lead Database Project (Sub-Agent Test)
- **Goal:** Consolidate all cached lead data into Supabase database
- **Sample CSV:** "Paralect Q1 1-50 US CANADA employee software-SaaS startups.csv" (208k leads)
- **Requirements:**
  - Deduplicate by email
  - Priority fields: First Name, Email, Company Name, Title
  - Handle column variations across different sources (Apollo, ZoomInfo, Crunchbase)
  - Store all enrichment data (52 columns in sample)
- **Spawned sub-agent:** lead-database-builder (Sonnet, 10min timeout)
- **Deliverables:** Supabase schema + Python upload script + setup docs
- **Testing:** First real sub-agent demo for Liam
- **Status:** Sub-agent working in background

## Campaign Fulfillment System Access
- **Location:** `/root/clawd/claude-code-projects/intelligence/`
- **Handoff doc:** Read CLAWDBOT_HANDOFF.md (complete system context)
- **Structure:**
  - 10-checkpoint workflow (Data Inventory → Email Copy → Live Campaigns)
  - SOPs for each checkpoint
  - Content agent files (newsletter, X posts, lead magnets)
  - Client folders (C2, CGS, Gestell, Hygraph, etc.)
  - EmailBison MCP server for API automation
- **Critical rules:**
  - NEVER create test steps on live campaigns
  - ALWAYS use confirm=true for write operations (MCP defaults to dry-run)
  - ALWAYS use cold-friendly offer framework for email copy

## MedVirtual Campaign Setup - IN PROGRESS
- **Spawned sub-agent:** medvirtual-campaign-sop (Opus, 30min timeout)
- **Task:** Execute checkpoints 01-07 (Data Inventory → Deliverability Check)
- **Source data:** 5 files in `medvirtual/initial data gathering/`
- **Output:** Will generate 7 checkpoint files in `medvirtual/RESEARCH/`
- **Commits:** Sub-agent will commit after each checkpoint
- **Status:** STOP before EmailBison deployment (checkpoints 08-09)
- **Review:** Liam will review all outputs before live deployment
