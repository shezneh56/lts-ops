## First Contact
- Met Liam — runs lead gen agency, cold outbound work
- Based in Spain, CET timezone
- Set up basic identity files
- Approach: iterate and improve over time, no need to nail everything on day one

## Setup
- Created USER.md, IDENTITY.md, memory/ directory
- Ready to start building

## WhatsApp Setup
- Initially linked +447716953711
- Switched to +16462940798 (US number)
- Both numbers now in allowlist

## Business Context
- Liam runs **Leads That Show** (leadsthat.show)
- Cold outbound appointment setting for enterprise clients
- ~10 clients, mainly cold email campaigns
- Moving upmarket from performance-based to enterprise positioning
- Key needs: prioritization, campaign effectiveness, operational efficiency

## Deep Dive Session
- Captured full business overview (see business-overview.md)
- Main bottlenecks: too much time on campaign setup, not enough on sales
- Critical: C2 Group renewal mid-Feb ($12.5k)
- Goal: $100k/month in Q1
- Need to build: sales follow-up automation, campaign assistance, inbox monitoring

## Systems Built Today
✅ Gmail API integration (liam@leadsthat.show access, warmup filtered: p0zfhi2t)
✅ Call tracker monitoring (Google Sheet sync)
✅ Daily WhatsApp alerts (8 AM CET) - urgent actions, follow-ups, HOT leads
✅ Calendly integration (tracking bookings)
✅ Fathom credentials stored

## New Workflow Requested
- When call booked → Remind Liam to send voice note (doesn't need me to send, he'll do it)
- Reminder cadence:
  - Immediate: "Send voice note to [Name]"
  - 11 PM CET if not done
  - 9 AM prospect's timezone if still not done
- No iMessage automation needed (Liam sends manually)

## Deep Dive #2 - Ideal Week & Task List
- Captured ideal week structure (see ideal-workflow.md)
- Identified cost-cutting opportunities: $5,960/mo potential savings
  - Mary (inbox): $5,160/mo → AI reply agent
  - Sharia (campaigns): $800/mo → AI automation
- Built prioritized task list (see PRIORITY-TASKS.md)
- Cash flow tight - Feb 15 payment decision urgent
