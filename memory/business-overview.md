# Business Overview - Leads That Show

## Current State
- Revenue: ~$5-10k/month (Dec did $25-30k USD with RC2 signing)
- Goal: $100k/month in Q1
- ~10 clients, cutting 3 non-performers
- Key priority: RC2 Group renewal mid-Feb ($12.5k payment)

## Operations

### Volume
- 50k emails/day for clients
- 3-5k emails/day for own sales
- 20k inboxes, 20k domains
- Mix Google/Microsoft (can set up Microsoft himself)

### Infrastructure
- Sequencer: send.leadsthat.show (EmailBaton custom)
- Sales inbox: liam@leadsthat.show (Gmail)
- Lead data: Scattered Excel files on MacBook
- TODO: Build Supabase database to consolidate

### Team & Costs
- **Jack:** SDR (C2 Group campaign dedicated)
- **Mary:** Inbox manager ($1,290/week = ~$5,160/mo) - handles email responses, calendar booking
  - REPLACEMENT TARGET: AI reply agent
- **Zina:** Warm caller (keeping - can't replace with AI)
- **Sharia:** VA ($800/mo, due Feb 15) - campaign setup via Clay
  - REPLACEMENT TARGET: AI automation
  - Decision needed: Cut now (save $600) or wait until Feb 15?

**Potential monthly savings:** ~$5,960/mo if Mary + Sharia replaced

## Client Service Model

### Three Tiers
1. Email
2. LinkedIn
3. Cold Calling

**Positioning:** Contact every decision-maker in TAM every 45-60 days (not just 3% in-market)

### Campaign SLA
1. Client signs → onboarding form
2. Deep research on personas (client provides ICP)
3. Get contacts
4. Write messaging
5. Segment
6. Set up campaign in sequencer
7. Get targets
8. Upload lead list (verify: MillionVerifier + BounceBan for catch-alls)
9. Start sending

**Dream state:** Set up all campaigns weekend/Monday morning, review Friday, don't touch during week

### Performance Metrics
- Reply rates (human)
- Positive replies
- Meetings booked
- NOT tracking open rates (vanity metric)

### Current Issues
- Client campaigns underperforming (messaging + deliverability + targeting)
- Apollo/databases saturated
- Need account-based flow: export accounts (Apollo free) → enrich people with job titles
- Spam filters constantly changing
- Auto-rule: if reply rate drops >50% daily, auto-change campaign copy

## Sales Pipeline

### Inbound
- LinkedIn

### Outbound
- liam@leadsthat.show Gmail inbox
- Tracking: spreadsheet (leads, call shows, follow-up dates)
- Problem: Ineffective, people get missed
- Manual Monday follow-ups
- NEED: Cadence system (1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 30 days, then monthly)

### Goal
- 5-10 sales calls/day (top priority for growth)
- Currently: too much time on campaign setup, not enough on sales

## Target Market (Own Sales)
- Sales leaders at 500-5k headcount companies
- B2B companies doing cold outbound

## Special Client: RC2 Group
- Full Tier 3 coverage (email + LinkedIn + calling)
- Account-based marketing (TAM smaller than expected)
- Contract renewal mid-Feb: $12.5k payment critical
- Jack (SDR) dedicated to this account

## Immediate Needs
1. Sales follow-up automation (replace manual spreadsheet)
2. Campaign setup/copywriting assistance
3. Task prioritization & calendar blocking
4. Inbox monitoring ("Liam, you didn't follow up with X")
5. Testimonial collection plan
6. Potentially automate inbox responses (replace VA)
