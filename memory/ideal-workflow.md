# Ideal Workflow & Task List

## Ideal Week Structure

**8-9 AM:** Wake up, start work
**9 AM - 12 PM:** Deep work - strategy, not campaign setup (currently doing client campaigns - WRONG)
**12-1 PM:** Sales calls start
**Afternoons:** Sales calls (currently running around on campaign setup - NEEDS TO STOP)

**Goal:** All campaign setup done Friday/Saturday, ready before Monday
- Campaigns scheduled for the week
- Email volume confirmed
- Monitoring set up

## Tasks Liam Shouldn't Be Doing

1. **Campaign setup** (end-to-end)
2. **Lead sourcing**
3. **Copywriting**

**Current state:** Sharia (VA) handles this via Clay ($800/mo, due Feb 15)
**Problem:** Unnecessary overhead, cash flow tight
**Potential saving:** Cut now = ~$200 charge instead of $800

## Team & Cost Analysis

**Sharia (VA):** $800/mo (Feb 15 payment)
- Does: Campaign setup via Clay
- Replacement plan: AI automation
- **Potential action:** Cut now to save $600

**Mary (Inbox Manager):** $1,290/week = ~$5,160/mo
- Does: Email responses, calendar back-and-forth booking
- Replacement plan: AI reply agent
- **Potential saving:** $5,160/mo

**Zina (Warm Caller):** Keep - can't replace with AI

**Total potential monthly savings:** ~$5,960/mo

## Sales Process Flow

1. Cold email outreach
2. Back & forth (Mary handles)
3. Call booked (Calendly)
4. Pre-call flow (automated from Calendly)
5. **NEW:** Text message + voice note
6. Call happens
7. Post-call:
   - **Option A:** Closed Won → Send proposal → Book 2nd call (if needed) → Close → Agreement → Invoice → Onboarding form → Onboarding call → Campaign setup
   - **Option B:** Closed Lost → Ignore
   - **Option C:** Follow up → Enter follow-up cadence

## Revenue Leak

**Performance-based deals:**
- Liam pays for infrastructure
- Now cut to ~10% of previous cost (good progress)
- Still takes time, not worth it
- **Action:** Focus on enterprise clients who pay upfront (like C2)

## Priority Focus

1. **Sales** - 5-10 calls/day
2. **Fulfillment for high-value clients** (C2 Group - strategic, manual work)
3. Strategy work using Claude Code

## Task List (To Be Prioritized)

### Urgent (Cash Flow & C2 Renewal)
- [ ] Review cost-cutting: Sharia decision (cut now vs Feb 15?)
- [ ] Link to finance agent for overhead guidance
- [ ] C2 Group campaign focus (strategic, manual)

### High Impact (Free Up Time for Sales)
- [ ] AI reply agent (replace Mary - $5k/mo saving)
- [ ] Campaign setup automation (replace Sharia - $800/mo saving)
- [ ] Fathom automation (call summaries → post-call emails)
- [ ] Call tracker auto-updates (summaries, follow-up tracking)

### Automation Setup
- [ ] Voice note reminder workflow (Calendly → WhatsApp reminders)
- [ ] Review sent emails for proposal templates
- [ ] Link to campaign setup AI agent
- [ ] Lead sourcing workflow (TBD approach)

### CRM
- [ ] Evaluate GoHighLevel as CRM replacement
- [ ] Set up proper pipeline tracking

### Review & Optimize
- [ ] Campaign performance deep dive (other Claude chats context)
- [ ] Template improvement (current proposals working, but could be better)
