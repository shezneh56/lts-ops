## SOPs Created Today
1. Apollo Company Export SOP - from Liam's Loom
2. Clay People Search SOP - from Liam's Loom
3. Hygraph Apollo SOP updated - 50 keywords (Apollo limit), 5 verticals
4. MedVirtual Apollo SOP updated - 50 keywords, 4 personas + job titles

## Research Completed
1. Apollo export automation - manual is best (API costs credits, scrapers risky)
2. Email enrichment cost comparison:
   - Current stack (ICYPEAS → Lead Magic → Million Verifier → Bounceback): $10.72/1k
   - Prospeo: $10.84/1k
   - In-house LinkedIn scraping: $19.30/1k (NOT worth it - LinkedIn doesn't show emails)
3. How email finding works - pattern matching, SMTP verification, data partnerships

## Shahria Performance Issues
- MedVirtual leads were wrong - only 1% health/fitness/medical
- Took 2 days to export companies; Liam did 50k in 30 minutes
- Root cause: Apollo SOP keywords were too restrictive (now fixed)
- Action: Time tracking sheet created, starts tomorrow
- Tasks: Time tracking + C2 competitor list

## Systems Working
- EmailBison MCP - create_campaign and create_full_sequence tools added
- Deliverability cron - 8am CET daily fingerprinting check
- Notion pages updated for both Hygraph and MedVirtual

## Key Decisions
- Apollo keyword limit now 50 (was unlimited, changed by Apollo)
- Manual Apollo export is best approach for now (free, safe)
- Prospeo $5k investment decision tied to enterprise deal closing
- Lead sourcing improvements on backlog (BuiltWith, technographic targeting)
