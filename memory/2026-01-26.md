## Notion Integration Setup
- API key: stored at `~/.config/notion/api_key`
- Clawd page: `2f4de1d95312808fbabcf36fd96d94de`
- Daily Notes folder: `17fde1d95312809caefed23ee5ab2ebd`
- Can now create/edit docs in Notion for Liam to review

## C2 ABM Work
- Created exec summary in Notion: `2f4de1d9-5312-814e-89fc-d3931ee0ec3c`
- Full research docs in `/root/clawd/claude-code-projects/intelligence/clients/c2-group/`
- 25 emails written across 5 persona campaigns
- Jack's SDR playbook included
- **9:30 PM CET call with C2 tonight** - contract renewal in ~2 weeks

## ECA (Enterprise Client Academy)
- Liam completed pre-call doc and pre-call email flow
- Anyone booking a call now gets the full sequence
- Calls start ~3-4 PM CET (sales mode)

## Project Status
- **MedVirtual:** Checkpoints 1-7 complete, needs Liam's review before EmailBison deployment
- **Lead Database:** Schema + upload script built at `/root/clawd/lead-database/`, needs Supabase credentials
- **FAQ Docs:** Pulled all 8 client docs. Has content: CGS, LawTech, Jampot, LTS. Empty: LegalSoft, Paralect, Wow24-7, Gestell

## Blocked Items
- **EmailBison API:** Key not configured in my environment - can't pull campaign stats directly
- **Google Calendar API:** No token file, can't access Liam's calendar
- **Clay:** Was down yesterday, need to check if working for C2 lead pull
- **LinkedIn filter:** Need to research "posted in last 30 days" filter

## Integration Status Updates
- Google Docs: NOT configured (no credentials)
- Notion: ✅ NOW WORKING
- EmailBison: Needs API key
- Calendar: Needs OAuth token

## Priority for Rest of Day
1. C2 leads from Clay (Liam needs to check if working)
2. Client campaign check (need EmailBison access)
3. MedVirtual review
4. FAQs expansion (background)
