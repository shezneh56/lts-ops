## MedVirtual Lead Sourcing (MAJOR WIN)

### NPI Registry - FREE Lead Source
- Discovered NPI Registry has FREE public API with all US healthcare providers
- Pulled 39,251 leads across 4 personas:
  - Chiropractors: 10,143 records
  - Dentists: 10,200 records
  - Family Medicine: 10,200 records
  - Dermatology: 8,708 records
- Data includes: NPI, Name, Org, Address, City, State, Zip, Phone
- Missing: Email, Website (need Clay to enrich)
- Files sent to Liam, saved at `/data/npi_medvirtual/`
- Liam tested dermatology in Clay: 2,800 websites found from 8.7K (32% match rate)

### Apollo Searches Created
- Generated INCLUDE/EXCLUDE keywords for all 4 personas
- Uploaded to Notion: https://www.notion.so/MedVirtual-Apollo-Searches-2f4de1d9531281c4bea2ded1f98898ca
- Shahria pulling Apollo company exports

### Niche Databases Research
- Full research saved to `/intelligence/clients/medvirtual/NICHE_DATABASES_MASTER.md`
- Key sources: ChiroDirectory (65K+), DentalPlans (25K+), ASDS (6,400+), NCQA PCMH (13K+)
- Combined with NPI = 100K+ potential leads

### ICP Docs Saved
- 5 ICP definition docs saved to `/intelligence/clients/medvirtual/initial data gathering/`
- Includes detailed NAICS codes, revenue/employee targets, competitor pricing

## C2 Campaign Strategy

### 4-Tier Plan Created
1. **ABM (Gold):** 2,500 Optimizely users, 10-year aged domains, multi-channel
2. **Lookalikes:** 21 current customers → find similar in Apollo
3. **Sitecore Displacement:** Competitive switch messaging
4. **DXP Competitors:** Adobe, Contentful, etc.

### ABM Sequence
- Day 1: Email 1
- Day 2: LinkedIn connection
- Day 3: Email 2
- Day 5: LinkedIn message
- Day 6: Cold call
- Day 8: Email 3

### Notion Docs Created
- C2 Call Plan: https://www.notion.so/C2-Call-Plan-26-Jan-22-00-2f4de1d953128144a474e00637cc34f6
- Trigify Research: https://www.notion.so/Trigify-Research-C2-ABM-2f4de1d9531281b9b0cef613281a927d

### Current Status
- 10-year domains started warming TODAY (were off)
- LinkedIn campaign set up for 400 C-suite followers
- Jack calling phones
- C2 call: 21:30-22:00 CET (NOT 22:00 as I mistakenly said)

## Trigify Research
- Don't monitor "Optimizely" keyword (returns employees/offshore teams)
- Instead: Upload 2,500 leads, monitor for engagement signals
- Track competitors: Sitecore, Adobe, Contentful engagement
- Key insight: Monitor PEOPLE, not keywords

## Apify/Scraper Research
- Full research at `/intelligence/LEAD_SOURCING_AUTOMATION_RESEARCH.md`
- Pipeline: NPI (free) + Apify (Google Maps) → Clay (enrich) → EmailBison
- Cost estimate: ~$100-200/mo for 10K healthcare leads

## System Rules Clarified
- **Zina** (reply handler): Only gets replies needing handling, NOT booked meetings
- **Mary** (FAQ builder): Only interested replies, NOT OOOs or not-interested (shelved for now)

## Integrations Working
- **Calendly:** API at `/root/clawd/gmail-integration/.env` - can pull bookings
- **Fathom:** API working - can pull call recordings
- **Notion:** Working - created multiple pages today
- **EmailBison:** All 11 workspace keys at `/config/workspace_keys.json`

## Kent Harkins Follow-up Needed
- Call: Jan 26, 7:01-7:58 PM CET (57 mins)
- Fathom URL: https://fathom.video/calls/545671281
- Share: https://fathom.video/share/5zP_yz-3YP-vdQfpSrVb6tpxpdRxbpTs
- Transcript still processing - need to draft post-call email

## Deliverability Alerts
- Jampot "JP V3 - SaaS" Step 4014 dropped 61%
- LawTech "USA - GC/Legal Ops" multiple steps at 0% open rate
- Data from Jan 23 - may need copy refresh

## Calendar Access Needed
- Liam wants me to have Google Calendar access
- Options: OAuth setup or iCal secret URL
- Currently don't have access - caused me to get C2 call time wrong

## Future Plans
- If MedVirtual lead sourcing works, roll to ALL clients
- Set up Calendly → phone enrichment flow (Clay lookup when missing)
- Daily Calendly check + text reminders for new bookings

## Formatting Note
- Liam asked me NOT to use markdown symbols that break on WhatsApp (like **bold**)
- Keep messages cleaner and simpler

## Email Formatting - CRITICAL
Liam sent a post-call email to Kent (Waverty) that I drafted. It was badly broken:
1. Only filled half the page width
2. Lines cut off / wrapped incorrectly  
3. Used CAPS headers and --- dividers

The root cause: I created a plain text email with hard line breaks in the raw content, which rendered terribly in Gmail.

**NEVER again:**
- Hard line breaks in email body
- CAPS section headers
- --- dividers
- Plain text with short line widths

**Fix for next time:**
- Use HTML Content-Type for drafts
- Or write continuous prose without manual line breaks
- Test the format before telling Liam it's ready
- Write like a normal human email - paragraphs, natural flow

## Evening Status
- 21:17 CET: Liam going to sauna
- C2 work still pending for after
- Kent (Waverty) post-call email sent (despite bad formatting)
- Follow-up call with Waverty: Wednesday Jan 29, 11:30 AM Pacific

## End of Day - Liam Signed Off 22:30 CET
