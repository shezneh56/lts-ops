## Soft Avoid (Context-Dependent)

These can work in the right context but use sparingly:

help
increase

results
success
growth
roi
performance
optimize
transform
```

**Rule:** One soft-avoid word per email max. Never in subject line.

| buy now | worth a conversation? |
| limited time | [remove urgency entirely] |
| % | percent (spelled out) or rephrase |
| save money | reduce costs, cut spend |
| increase revenue | grow, improve, lift |

[ ] No "click here" or "buy now"
[ ] No fake RE:/FW: threading

[ ] P.S. line clean

## Why This Matters

Modern spam filters use machine learning trained on billions of emails. They don't just look for individual words—they look for patterns.

An email with:
- "Free" in the subject
- "$" in the body
- "Act now" as a CTA
- "!!!" anywhere

...will almost certainly hit spam, even if each element alone might pass.

**The goal:** Sound like a human having a professional conversation, not a marketer trying to sell something.
