[ ] List is clean (no catch-alls, bounces, or spam traps)
[ ] Opt-out mechanism in place (if required by law)
```

---

## Post-Launch Monitoring

```
[ ] Monitor bounce rates (<2% acceptable)

## If Deliverability Drops

1. **Pause campaign** immediately
2. **Check EmailBison** or similar for flagged variants
3. **Review sent copy** against blacklist
4. **Refresh flagged variants** with new copy
5. **Test new variants** before resuming
6. **Reduce volume** when resuming
7. **Monitor closely** for 48-72 hours
