# Spintax Patterns & Rules

Spintax creates natural variation across email sends, improving deliverability and avoiding pattern detection.

---

## Core Rules

### 1. Minimum 3 Alternatives Per Bracket
```
❌ {good|great}
✅ {good|great|solid}
✅ {find|discover|navigate to|locate}
```

### 2. Alternatives Must Be Natural Substitutes
```
❌ {built|designed|created the strategy for}  ← different lengths break flow
✅ {built|designed|created}
✅ {redesigned|rebuilt|overhauled}
```

### 3. Match Grammar Across Options
```
❌ {finding|to find|find}  ← mixed forms
✅ {finding|discovering|locating}
✅ {to find|to discover|to locate}
```

### 4. Use Spintax in Subject Lines
```
Subject: {student enrollment|enrollment experience|the enrollment journey} at {COMPANY}
Subject: {site navigation question|quick navigation question|finding programs on your site}
```

### 5. Spread Throughout Email (Not Clumped)
Spintax should appear:
- In the subject line
- In the opening hook
- In the body (proof points)
- In the CTA
- In the P.S.

## Testing Your Spintax

Before delivery, expand a few random combinations to ensure:
1. Every combination reads naturally
2. No awkward phrasing when alternatives combine
3. Sentence length stays reasonable across variants
