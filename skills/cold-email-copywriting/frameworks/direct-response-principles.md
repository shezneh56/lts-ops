# Direct Response Principles for Cold Email

These principles come from direct response copywriting—adapted for B2B cold email where brevity and clarity win.

## Core Principles

### 1. One Idea Per Line
Break up dense paragraphs. Each line should contain one thought.

```
❌ We redesigned the enrollment journey for a 79,000-student college district and watched completion rates climb, which meant more students were finding programs and actually enrolling.

✅ We redesigned the enrollment journey for a 79,000-student college district.
   Watched completion rates climb.
```

### 2. Short Sentences
Under 15 words is ideal. Over 20 needs a good reason.

```
❌ We've been working with enterprise organizations to help them improve their digital experiences for over a decade now.

✅ We've spent a decade on this.
```

### 3. Start with the Prospect
First word should be `{FIRST_NAME}` or reference their company/situation.

```
❌ Hi there, we're a digital experience agency...
❌ Our company specializes in...

✅ {FIRST_NAME}, what if prospects at {COMPANY} could...
✅ {FIRST_NAME}, how confident is {COMPANY} in...
```

### 4. No Greetings
Skip "Hi," "Hey," "Hello," "Dear."

```
❌ Hi {FIRST_NAME},
❌ Hello {FIRST_NAME},
❌ Hey there,

✅ {FIRST_NAME},
```

### 5. Questions Over Statements
Questions engage. Statements inform. Engage first.

```
❌ Your website could be losing prospects.
✅ How many prospects give up on your site before they convert?

❌ We can help you improve navigation.
✅ Can prospects actually find what they need?
```

### 6. Proof in the P.S.
The P.S. gets read. Put your strongest proof point there.

```
P.S. That district awarded over 10,000 degrees last year.
P.S. 10+ year partnership. Still going strong.
P.S. Just won Optimizely's 2024 Partner of the Year.
```

### 7. Soft CTAs
Don't demand. Invite.

```
❌ Schedule a call with me now.
❌ Click here to book a demo.

✅ Worth a conversation?
✅ Would this approach help {COMPANY}?
✅ Open to a quick chat?
```

### 8. Specificity Beats Vagueness
Numbers, names, and details create credibility.

```
❌ We've helped many companies improve their sites.
✅ We've spent 10 years helping a 79,000-student district.

❌ We've seen great results.
✅ They awarded 10,000+ degrees last year.
```

## Email Structure Template

```
{FIRST_NAME}, [hook question or provocative statement]

[1-2 sentences of proof/credibility]

[Optional: soft CTA question]

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}

P.S. [Strongest proof point with specific numbers]
```

**Target length:** 50-100 words in the body (excluding signature)

## What to Avoid

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| "I hope this email finds you well" | Filler, wastes space |
| "I wanted to reach out because..." | Self-focused, passive |
| "We're a leading provider of..." | Nobody cares about your positioning |
| "I'd love to pick your brain" | Vague, no value exchange |
| "Let me know your thoughts" | Weak CTA, easy to ignore |
| "Looking forward to hearing from you" | Passive, presumptuous |

---

## Rhythm and Flow

Read your email out loud. It should sound like a human talking, not a brochure.

Good rhythm:
- Short sentence.
- Medium sentence with one idea.
- Question?

Bad rhythm:
- Long compound sentence with multiple ideas that keeps going and going until the reader loses track of the point you were trying to make.

## The "Delete Test"

For every sentence, ask: "If I deleted this, would the email still work?"

If yes, delete it.

Cold email is not the place for context-setting, pleasantries, or throat-clearing. Get to the point.
