# Cold Email Copywriting Skill

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when the user requests:
- Cold email campaign copywriting
- Outbound email sequences
- "Write emails for [company/campaign]"
- Email variations/spintax
- B2B prospecting emails

## Core Framework: 7 Variations + Follow-up

Every campaign produces **7 unique Step 1 variations** + **1 Step 2 follow-up**.

### The 7 Angles

| Variation | Angle | Hook Style |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **1** | Journey/Process | "What if [prospects] could [complete journey] without [friction]?" |
| **2** | Search/Navigation | "Can [audience] actually find [what they need] on your site?" |
| **3** | Accessibility/Compliance | "How confident is [COMPANY] in your [compliance area]?" |
| **4** | Custom/Industry-Specific | Tailored to prospect's unique context (multi-location, vertical, etc.) |
| **5** | Credibility | Lead with award, recognition, or partnership length |
| **6** | Problem-Focused | "How many [prospects] give up before [desired action]?" |
| **7** | Direct Value Question | "Is [COMPANY]'s [asset] actually helping—or getting in the way?" |

### Step 2: Follow-up

- References Step 1 subject line (Re: {original subject})
- Short "bumping this up" opener
- Restates core value prop
- Clear CTA for time

## File References

- **Framework details:** `frameworks/7-variation-structure.md`
- **Spintax rules:** `frameworks/spintax-patterns.md`
- **Direct response principles:** `frameworks/direct-response-principles.md`
- **Spam blacklist:** `spam-avoidance/blacklist-words.md`
- **Formatting rules:** `spam-avoidance/formatting-rules.md`
- **Templates:** `templates/` directory

## Variable Standards

**Always use these exact formats:**
- `{FIRST_NAME}` — recipient's first name
- `{COMPANY}` — recipient's company name
- `{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}` — sender's signature block

**Never use:**
- `{{double braces}}`
- `[FIRST_NAME]` brackets
- `<COMPANY>` angle brackets

## Quick Rules

1. **Start every email with `{FIRST_NAME},`** — no Hi/Hey/Hello
2. **3+ alternatives per spintax bracket** — `{option1|option2|option3}`
3. **Short sentences** — one idea per line
4. **P.S. with proof points** — stats, awards, partnership length
5. **No spam words** — see `spam-avoidance/blacklist-words.md`
