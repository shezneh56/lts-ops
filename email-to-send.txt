Hey Fareed,

Thanks for taking the time today. I appreciate you walking me through Steward Global Consulting and what you're looking for in terms of scaling your product demo meetings and growing to $4.2M in 2026.

I wanted to follow up with a summary of what we discussed and outline how we can help.

Your Current Situation

You're running a healthcare staffing company focused on back-end revenue cycle management. You help healthcare organizations (medical groups, hospital systems, academic medical centers) onboard experienced offshore staff to reduce costs and address staffing challenges.

Your ICP is any healthcare organization with IT infrastructure needs, targeting CFOs, VPs of Revenue Cycle, and Directors as decision makers. Your pricing is $2,600-$7,000 per FTE/month depending on role complexity, with a preference for minimum 5 FTE contracts.

You've grown 100% organically:
• Year 1 (2023): $170K revenue
• Year 2 (2024): $1.3M revenue
• Year 3 (2025): $2.1M revenue
• 0 dollars spent on marketing

You recently resigned from your executive role to focus full-time on scaling Steward. Your goal is to double revenue to $4.2M in 2026, which requires approximately 14 new clients (averaging 10 FTEs each) or 10 qualified meetings per month at a 20% close rate.

You've been interviewing other agencies (larger, more established firms) and are looking for a long-term partner who can guarantee qualified meetings.

The Perfect Timing

Trump's tax bill ("one big, beautiful bill") is impacting hospital margins significantly. CFOs are already struggling, and this creates urgency to reduce costs. This is the perfect trigger to position Steward as the solution to their staffing challenges while addressing margin pressure.

Our Solution

We specialize in cold outbound at scale through email, LinkedIn, and cold calling. For your situation, I'd recommend starting with email + LinkedIn because your TAM is massive (every healthcare organization with 25+ employees in the U.S.).

Here's how it would work:

Full TAM Coverage Every 45-60 Days
• Map all CFOs, VPs of Revenue Cycle, and Directors at healthcare organizations (100K+ decision makers)
• 3,000-5,000 emails/day (vs. your current 0)
• 2-email sequence covering full TAM every 6-8 weeks
• Target CFOs (budget authority), VPs/Directors (operational need)
• Messaging focused on: Cost reduction via offshore staffing + tax bill impact trigger

Three Tiers Available

Tier 1: Email Only - $7,500/month
• 3,000-5,000 emails/day
• Output: 20-30 qualified meetings/month
• 2x-3x your monthly goal

Tier 2: Email + LinkedIn - $10,000/month
• 3,000-5,000 emails/day
• 5-10 LinkedIn accounts sending 100-200 connections/week each
• Output: 30-40 qualified meetings/month
• 3x-4x your monthly goal

Tier 3: Email + LinkedIn + Dedicated SDR - $15,000/month
• 3,000-5,000 emails/day
• 5-10 LinkedIn accounts
• Dedicated SDR doing 100 dials/day + warm calling on positive email/LinkedIn replies
• Output: 40-50+ qualified meetings/month
• 4x-5x your monthly goal

How It Works

All engagements are 90 days (quarterly). Here's the timeline:
• Week 1-2: Infrastructure setup (email warmup, TAM mapping, copywriting around tax bill trigger)
• Week 3+: Launch outbound, start booking meetings

Payment: Monthly payments (discount if quarter paid upfront)

My Recommendation

Start with Tier 2 (Email + LinkedIn - $10,000/month) for Q1. This will get you 30-40 meetings/month, which is 3x-4x your goal of 10/month and gives you buffer for the 20% close rate you mentioned.

Why Tier 2 over Tier 1:
• LinkedIn adds credibility for healthcare executives (they're on it constantly)
• Multi-channel = higher response rates
• Tax bill trigger + LinkedIn visibility = urgency

If it works well, we can scale to Tier 3 in Q2 to add cold calling for maximum coverage.

You asked to speak with companies we've worked with that have a similar business model. Here are three SaaS/software companies we've worked with:

1. CGS Team - Tech/Software Development (email only) - 24 calls in 6 weeks - $1.2M pipeline added

I'll intro you via email so you can jump on a call with them to discuss their experience.

The ROI Case

Investment: $10,000/month = $30,000 for Q1
Output: 30 meetings/month × 3 months = 90 meetings
At 20% close rate: 18 deals
At 10 FTEs average × $3,000/FTE: $30K/month per client = $360K/month = $4.32M annualized
ROI: 144x in annual contract value

Even at conservative 10% close rate: 9 deals = $2.16M annualized = 72x ROI

Based on your growth goals ($4.2M target), Tier 2 gets you there in Q1 alone.

Addressing Your Concerns

On Performance-Based Pricing:
I understand you're looking for a commission or contingency-based model. We don't operate that way because we can't control your sales process (close rates, follow-up, pricing decisions, etc.).

However, we do offer quarterly guarantees: If we don't deliver the agreed-upon number of qualified meetings over the 90-day period, we'll continue working at no additional cost until we hit the number.

Qualification Criteria:
We'll define this together during onboarding. For your business, I'd suggest:
• Title: CFO, VP/Director of Revenue Cycle, COO
• Company: Healthcare organization, 50+ employees
• Expressed interest in cost reduction or staffing solutions
• Scheduled meeting on your calendar

If someone fits these criteria and shows up to the call, they count as qualified.

Next Steps

Here's what I'd suggest:

1. Review the pricing and tiers - Let me know if Tier 2 makes sense or if you'd prefer to start with Tier 1
2. Reach out to the references and have a conversation about their experience
3. Compare with other agencies you're evaluating - I'm confident our TAM coverage approach + quarterly guarantee will outperform rev-share models that focus on triggers alone
4. Let me know by end of week - If you want to move forward, I'll send over the agreement and we can start setup next week to capitalize on the tax bill timing

I know you mentioned having other options lined up. My honest take: If they're offering pure rev-share with no minimums, test them first. But if they want long-term contracts, large upfront payments, or can't provide healthcare references (like the firms you mentioned interviewing), we're the better fit.

Looking forward to hearing from you and helping you hit $4.2M in 2026.
