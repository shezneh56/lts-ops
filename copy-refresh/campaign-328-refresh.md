## Summary

| Step | Old Subject | Issue | Reply Rate Drop |
|------|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| 2179 | pipeline predictability | No spintax, template-like | 68% |
| 2180 | 75 meetings per quarter | Repetitive structure | 75% |
| 2181 | quick question | Spam-flagged subject | 84% |
| 2182 | the prediction | Too cute, repetitive phrases | 66% |

**Root Cause:** All 4 steps share identical sentence structures and repeated phrases ("quarter after quarter", "predictable pipeline"). No spintax = fingerprinted fast.
