## Current Copy (Underperforming)

**Subject:** `{FIRST_NAME} - ops support`

**Body:**
```
{FIRST_NAME}, we provide dedicated ops assistants to SaaS companies—vetted for 12 hours, Culture Index matched, already familiar with your tools.

2,600/month instead of 100k/year. 30-day pilot.

What's the single biggest ops task draining time at {COMPANY} right currently?

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}
```

**Issues identified:**
1. Opens with "we provide" — company-centric, not prospect-focused
2. "right currently" is grammatically awkward
3. Zero spintax — highly fingerprintable
4. Too short and generic
5. Subject line is bland
6. No P.S. with proof points

---

## Fresh Copy (Replacement)

**Angle:** Observation/Problem-focused — notice the pattern, name the pain

**Subject:** `{FIRST_NAME} - {quick ops question|ops bandwidth|SaaS ops capacity}`

**Body:**
```
{FIRST_NAME}, {noticed something|ran into a pattern|saw this a lot} working with SaaS companies {similar to|like|in the same space as} {COMPANY}.

{The founder or COO|Someone senior|A key person} ends up buried in ops work that {doesn't move the needle|could be delegated|isn't strategic}. Calendar management, CRM cleanup, vendor coordination — {the list grows|it compounds|it piles up}.

We help teams {like yours|at your stage|in SaaS} add dedicated ops capacity in {14 days|two weeks|under a month}. {No job posts, no interviews|Skip the hiring process|Without the usual hiring pain} — our assistants are {vetted for 12 hours|pre-vetted extensively|thoroughly screened} before they start.

{What's the one ops task|Which recurring task|What's the single thing} that {eats the most time|drains the most hours|takes up the most bandwidth} at {COMPANY} right now?

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}

P.S. Our average client saves {20+ hours per week|over 80 hours monthly|a full day per week} once their assistant is {ramped up|onboarded|up to speed}.
```

1. `{FIRST_NAME} - {quick ops question|ops bandwidth|SaaS ops capacity}` ← recommended

## Why This Works Better

| Element | Old Copy | New Copy |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Opening | "We provide..." (company-focused) | "Noticed something..." (observation) |
| Spintax | None | 10+ variation points |
| Pain points | Generic "ops task" | Specific examples (calendar, CRM, vendors) |
| Proof | None | P.S. with hours-saved stat |
| Tone | Transactional | Conversational/consultative |
| Length | Too short | Optimal (under 100 words, good density) |

## Implementation Notes

1. **Replace step 4014** with fresh copy above
2. **Monitor first 200 sends** for reply rate recovery
3. **Target:** 2%+ reply rate (matches top performer 4012)
4. **Fallback:** If still underperforms after 300 sends, try the "buried in ops?" subject line variant

---

## Campaign Context

**Top performer to emulate:** Step 4012 (2.31% reply)
- Opens with prospect's situation
- Longer, more detailed
- Specific tool names and scenarios

**Worst performer to avoid:** Step 4013 (0.66% reply)
- "Scale of 1-10" question feels survey-ish
- Too generic
