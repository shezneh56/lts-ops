### 4. Three Tiers Available

All engagements are 90 days (quarterly). Timeline:

- Week 3+: Launch outbound, start booking meetings

Payment: Monthly payments (discount if quarter paid upfront)

### 6. My Recommendation
Start with [Tier X] for Q1. This will get you [meetings/month], which is [multiplier]x your current volume and [exceeds/meets] your goal of [their goal]. If it works well, we can add [upsell] in Q2 to scale further.

### 7. References

### 8. The ROI Case
Investment: [Tier price]/month = [Quarter total] for Q1
Output: [meetings/month] × 3 months = [total meetings] meetings
At 20% close rate: [closes] deals
At $[ACV] average: $[revenue] in new revenue
ROI: [multiplier]x

Even at 10% close rate and $[lower ACV], you're looking at [deals] = $[revenue] = [multiplier]x ROI.

### 9. Next Steps

2. Reach out to the references and have a conversation about their experience
3. Let me know which tier makes the most sense for you
4. If you want to move forward, I'll send over the agreement and we can start setup this week
